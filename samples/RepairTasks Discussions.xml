I have a lock on a folder in my windows/system32/tasks/microsoft/windows &lt;br&gt;
the file is SyncCenter should this file have a lock if not what do i need to do to remove the
&lt;br&gt;
lock and share the file? OS is windows 7 home 32 bit.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;What do you mean by a lock? What symptoms are you seeing? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sync Center is a Windows feature that keeps local and server files at the same version, and I think is turned off by default. The SyncCenter folder is empty on my system, so it’s probably one of those where a background task gets created when you configure
 synchronisation. Have you done that? &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thanks for replying. &lt;br&gt;
Your program is marvelous. It solved the many problems that I was having with my task scheduler.
&lt;br&gt;
The lock that I am talking about is a padlock symbol on the file. The padlock is not allowing the file to be shared.
&lt;br&gt;
I do not know if this is the way the file is supposed to be (not shared) or should it be shared.
&lt;br&gt;
I am unsure if the padlock should be removed from the file, so that it can be shared, and if so, who it can be shared with? Ex. everyone?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To answer your question about configuring synchronisation, I don't know how to do that.
&lt;br&gt;
The reason why I used your program is because I lost all my restore points and when I went into Task Scheduler, it showed me error messages saying,
&lt;br&gt;
"Task Image is corrupt 0X80041321". I used your program to fix these corrupt files. All files are now correct, but I have this padlock situation.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In your files that I downloaded the SyncCenter does not show a padlock, so I am confused on what I need to do to make this file correct?
&lt;br&gt;
My operating system is working absolutely fine now, but I just don't know what to do about the padlock.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I think you’re in the clear. The lock just means restricted access, and I suspect that the SyncCenter folder is restricted because it is intended to have its contents managed only by the SyncCenter configuration application, which is accessible from the
 Control Panel. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But if you’re not setting that up in the first place, then I don’t think you have an issue, and can safely carry on using your now recovered system.

Wondering if any of the 11 Task errors on my system are part of Windows 7? &lt;br&gt;
I had tried upgrading to Windows 10 at some time in the past, and then reverted back to Windows 7....so perhaps these tasks were added at that time?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;All 11 of them are tasks installed by Windows 10 that have no counterpart in Windows 7. You can safely ignore them. They are exactly those described in the documentation page you reference.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I have used your software many times in the past year with great success. Tried to repair my HTPC running Windows 7 ultimate. Once it finished repairing it now gives me error The selected task “{0}” no longer exists. To see the current tasks, click Refresh.
 This screen comes up twice. I gone into the task folder to see when the error is presented. Strangely it shows the error when I click on different folders. I close the scheduler down and restart it and click on other folders and it will give the error message
 on different folders. Any ideas how I might be able to fix this issue. Thank you.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I assume that the message “The selected task “{0}” no longer exists” is being produced by the Task Scheduler. What does Repair Tasks report when you run its Scan?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi John &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What Repair Tasks is saying is that “Point_Creator” is not a standard Windows 7 task. Did you install any third party software that may have set up this task? There is a download called ‘Restore Point Creator’, for example, but I don’t know if it sets up this
 task. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, the easiest way to restore this task is simply to reinstall the software involved.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My apologies for the slow response, but I have been off-line for a couple of weeks.
&lt;br&gt;

    <Discussion Title="Missing maintenance tasks - not detected by the RepairTasks program?">
      <Posts>
        <Post From="Bluhman" When="30/01/2017 23:11:08">
          <Html>
        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi, I'm using your software to fix my Windows 8.1 tasks after reverting from a Windows 10 upgrade. The program was able to fix an annoying issue where an XML error pertaining to RAC kept popping up in the Task Scheduler, but I have another issue I've been
 seeking to fix: my automatic system maintenance just doesn't run and I have no way to configure its settings. It just returns the error:
&lt;em&gt;"Windows is unable to run automatic maintenance. The maintenance scheduler is unavailable. "&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thing is, Repair Tasks scans over the TaskScheduler folder, but reports no issues. I finally figured out where the tasks are in my system, and compared the Windows 8.1 tasks ZIP to my system:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The ZIP image has 4 tasks in it: Idle_Maintenance, Maintenance_Configurator, Manual_Maintenace, and Regular_Maintenance. Mine had 0 tasks. Not sure why the program didn't pick that up.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So I went and attempted to append the entries inside the Windows 8.1 image into my system via the Task Scheduler, but got stopped when attempting to add the Maintenance_Configurator. My computer says: "Task Scheduler service is not available. Task Scheduler
 will attempt to reconnect to it" whenever I attempt to click OK. I actually don't know if I should be doing it like this. Is the program not modifying the Task Scheduler's tasks a bug or do I need to take different steps to fix my issue?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          <Html>
        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Firstly, watch out for task names. The XML files in the zip have blanks in their names replaced with underscores. So you should not be adding Idle_Maintenance, but Idle Maintenance. you should rename the extracted XML file. Also, I suspect that, if Windows
 is to find the task, you also need to add it in the right folder, i.e. Microsoft/Windows/TaskScheduler.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Secondly, if the Task Scheduler service is not available, this implies that the Scheduler service is not running (you can check by opening Task Manager, switching to the Services tab, and scrolling down to Scheduler). However, if this is the case, Repair Tasks
 will not run a Scan without error, but will instead report network errors for every installed task. Did you try these two things in the same boot session?
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thank you so much for your reply.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Alrighty. I ended up getting rid of the tasks I just sort of pasted in a few days ago, so that's no longer an issue. I was dropping the tasks in the right folder, but didn't know anything about replacing the underscores with spaces.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The last time I checked, yes. I tried these two actions within the same boot. Currently I can verify that my Task Scheduler service is running, but I am still unable to do automatic maintenance. Consistent with that, the Repair Tasks program is still able to
 run properly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I should note that the error being returned only shows up when I attempt to run maintenance in the action center manually. Anything else related to tasks seems to run properly within the Task Scheduler (without any error popups). Just within there, I see some
 failed tasks relating to the Maintenance Configurator and Regular Maintenance tasks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'll see if I have any better luck if I remove the underscores from those files. Thanks!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
EDIT: So the way I've been attempting to add the services manually to the Task Scheduler is to navigate to the folder that needs the tasks, choose 'import task', switch to 'all files' instead of 'XML files', and take the files inside the package. I tried doing
 the XML itself, but it returned this error:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Image" src="http://i.imgur.com/xYOebd9.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I believe it did that both before and after I renamed the file from "[Content_Types].xml" to "[Content Types].xml". Doing the task files themselves seemed to work when they had underscores in them. When attempting to add them with spaces,
 however, they seemed to break the task scheduler UI and I become unable to read data in the task scheduler until I reopen it.&lt;br&gt;
I really don't feel comfortable trying to do it in this method, as it seems like it only will legally add the tasks to the list if it has the underscores in the name. I myself really would like to understand why the Repair Tasks program isn't taking any action
 to put it in there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Again, thank you so much for your advice.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Okay, here’s another way you can go about installing the tasks required. Open the zip file in one Explorer window, and in another open Windows\System32\Tasks. You may need to grant yourself permission to access the latter. In the second window, navigate
 to the Microsoft\Windows\TaskScheduler, and copy in the missing task files from the zip file. Change all the underscores in the copied file names to blanks (these files do not and should not have extensions).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now run Repair Tasks. When you run Scan, the copied in files should show up as not being installed. You should then be able to run Repair in the default mode to install them.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let me know how you get on. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Alright, I did those steps and got up to when I needed to run Repair Tasks. Repair Tasks didn't display anything, so I went back into the Task Scheduler in Administrative tools, checked under Microsoft/Windows/TaskScheduler, and there they all were! Didn't
 even have to do anything with Repair Tasks or adding tasks, apparently just pasting the files in there with the right names and it just registered them properly.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So then I went into the action center, attempted to start a manual maintenance, and it's running! For the first time in like 2 years my computer can do maintenance on itself. Again, thank you so much for providing personal help on how to fix my problem.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello everyone! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I downloaded Repair Tasks &amp;amp; I don't know what choice to make in the window that appears when I open it. Please help me know what to do.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Some info you may need to know: The current computer I'm using (HP Compaq Presario Notebook) was given to me by a sister. She had upgraded to Windows 10 on it and almost immediately (well before the 30th day) reverted back to Windows 7 Home Premium Service
 Pack 1 64 bit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I can't do a backup the normal way. Thankfully, I have Norton Security Suite and it provides a backup. I backed it up onto an external storage device. Since one of the choices given by this Repair Tasks product has an option of "Take tasks from backup",
 I'm not sure how to proceed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I especially don't know what "Recycle existing tasks" means. Do I do one option, then the other? Please explain everything to me thoroughly in a step by step way. I am a complete tech dummy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Your best bet is to go to the Documentation page on the Repair Tasks site, and follow the link to a walk-through that appears near the top of the page. This gives step-by-step instructions for using the utility.

I started following the instructions on the Documentation page and ran into an issue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Step 4 says: "Create a Folder called AAAAATASK in your Documents (Which can be found START &amp;gt; Documents) C:\Users\David\Documents\AAAAATASK"
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, one cannot go to Documents in Windows 7 and start a folder with a : in the name. So, I can't create a document and type in: C: and then the rest.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;C:\Users\David\Documents\AAAAATASK is the full path. If you are in Explorer, in the Documents folder, then you just need to create a folder called AAAAATASK.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Because the path to the Documents folder is C:\Users\David\Documents, this will create a folder whose full path is indeed C:\Users\David\Documents\AAAAATASK

This most likely indicates that the Schedule service is not running. You can check this by opening up Task Manager, selecting the Services tab, and scrolling down to the Schedule service. Its Status should be Running, but I suspect that it is Stopped.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;First off, I am grateful for the effort here at CodePlex from DIIJI. &lt;br&gt;
I faced some issues, however, that I would like to share in hopes of some guidance.
&lt;br&gt;
I have Windows 7 Home Edition, and I too, had reversed a Windows 10 upgrade back to the original Windows 7. I learned with a recent attempt to back up my computer that I had a problem. I couldn't back up, receiving the "task image is corrupt or has been
 tampered with" (0x80041321). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I then went to check Task Scheduler and found numerous errors reporting.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After finding this web resource, I followed instructions, created a "AAAAA" folder in Documents, copied in the exe and config files from Repair Tasks, and the zip file Windows7Tasks.zip, then attempted to run the exe file, as Administrator. It
 simply would not run -- I tried about 5 times (including shutting down my Avast Antivirus). I then ran my computer in Safe Mode, and the TaskRepair.exe then ran.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Scan returned a result of 130 problems. I then ran the Repair with "Recycle existing tasks", but there were no improvements. Next, I ran Repair with "Take tasks from backup". I followed the prompt to the zipped file location (I did
 not unzip it), and ran the Repair. Again, no improvements; still 130 problems registered.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
I wanted to attach the Scan and Repair results but don't see an attachment option here. I will copy the Repair results below to the extent that the Discussion character limit (10,000) allows. I would appreciate any guidance or suggestions as to how to remedy
 these 130 problems in Task Scheduler, and how to address my original problem with Windows 7 Backup.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Arby 1&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yes, I too find it frustrating that there is no attachment option for discussions. Still, what you could fit in gives me a pretty clear picture of what is going on.&lt;br&gt;
Your trace contains three types of error: “does not contain task file”, “Part URI is not valid” and “The network address is invalid”.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The first two types relate to running the repair using the zip file. The zip file contains only standard Microsoft defined tasks, and the first error is reporting that the task is not one of them. The second error is reporting that not only is the task not
 Microsoft defined, but it doesn’t have a name that would be valid if it were.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The last error is the most important. It signifies that the system is not in a state that will allow tasks to be registered. I would be willing to make a small wager that if you ran Repair without the zip file, all repair attempts would fail with this error.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So what do you need to do to fix it? The first thing to do is to check that the Schedule service is running. Go to Task Manager, select the Services tab, sort by the name column, and scroll down until you see the Schedule service. It’s Status should be Running.
 What do you see on your system?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
FYI the error is actually being reported by the underlying system utility that Repair Tasks uses. You should be able to reproduce it by typing 'schtasks /query' at a command line. The most common cause of this problem is that the Schedule service is not running,
 as you will see if you Google the error message combined with 'schtasks'.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello Dijji, and thank you for your prompt reply and thoughts. I understand that the Repair Results were of 3 types, as described by you, and that the last is the most important. I will attempt to run Repair without the zip file to see if it returns the
 result that you venture. But, I am a little puzzled procedurally. My understanding is that the zip file referred to is the file: "Windows7 Tasks.zip"? How would I run Repair without the zip file? Does that mean run Scan, then run Repair using the
 button "Recycle existing tasks"?, or does it mean run Scan, then run Repair using the button "Take tasks from backup" but don't select the zip file?, or...? as you can see I am a little confused here.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Second, I checked the Services tab of Task Manager and confirmed that the Schedule service is "Running".
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thirdly, I went to the Cmd line and ran "schtasks/query", and it generated pages of results.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For the Services, Services "not running", Cmd "schtasks/query", and other RepairTask results, I could forward these to you as screen capture attachments, if it would be useful diagnostically and there were an address to which these could
 be forwarded? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I could not see any Service related to Windows Backup, nor any Tasks in Task Manager, and, Windows Backup is what originally led me to this effort.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do you have any guidance to me on why RepairTasks will not run on my computer except in Safe Mode?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As you can probably tell, I feel like I have a limited understanding of this. Before getting your above reply, I was inclined to go back to point zero and reformat and install Windows 7 from my backup disk, after copying my data files to an exterior disc. Of
 course, I would like to avoid that long process of re-installation, updating and copying back the data files.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;OK, Dijji, I think I follow on the "wager" on Scan and Repair without Zip. On the the Scan and Repair (Recycle existing tasks), yes, all 130 entries reported 'ERROR: The network address is invalid.' Otherwise, same questions remain in my previous
 post above. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;And, Dijji, one more thing. I checked the Task error list against the "current list" of Windows 10 tasks left behind in the reversion from W10 to W7, and all 11 of the W10 tasks listed are in my Task errors.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Rob &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Well, that is not entirely what I expected, but clear enough. Let’s dig in a little deeper by trying one semi manually, using the following steps:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up Repair Tasks, and scan. Select the line for \Microsoft\Windows\Autochk\Proxy, and click on Unplug Task.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Explorer, go to \Windows\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\Autochk, and copy the file Proxy to a temporary location, for instance c:\temp. Once the file is been successfully copied, delete it in \Windows\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\Autochk, or
 if your antivirus inhibits this, rename it to anything different. e.g. xProxy &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open a command line with administrator privileges(type cmd in the search box, right click on the program that shows up, which should be cmd.exe, and click on Run as administrator).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enter the following command, amending 'c:\temp\Proxy' to the location of your copied file, as required&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
schtasks /create /tn \Microsoft\Windows\Autochk\Proxy /xml c:\temp\Proxy&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This will attempt to reinstall the task. Let me know what results you get. The same procedure, by the way, can be used with any of the failing tasks. It is just a mostly manual version of what Repair Tasks does.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello Dijji. Because I have to go to Safe Mode (no access to Internet) to run the RepairTasks and go to normal mode to access the Internet, the process of repeatedly booting up to go back and forth is a bit tedious. I wish I could figure out how to run
 RepairTasks in normal mode rather than just Safe Mode. while in normal mode, I tried shutting down my anti-virus program (Avast) and that made no difference. I wonder what could be the problem for running in normal mode?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, here are the latest results. When I first went through the instructions, the result I got at the Command line was: Error: The network address is invalid. Being unsure of my input, I ran the Command again, this time cutting and pasting exactly your Command
 instruction -- that gave the following result: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
\Windows\system32&amp;gt;schtasks /create /tn \Microsoft\Windows\Autochk\proxy /xml c:\Temp\Proxy
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
SUCCESS: The scheduled task “\Microsoft\Windows\Autochk\Proxy" has successfully been created.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After that, when I went back to run RepairTasks, I ran Scan and it returned only: 'Error the network address is invalid'.
&lt;br&gt;
When I then ran repair with Recycle existing tasks, it returned 0 succeeded. &lt;br&gt;
When I then ran repair with Take tasks from backup, it returned 0 succeeded. and Proxy failed with Error: 'Error the network address is invalid'
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Rob &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My limited understanding of this... there is a task file in Task Scheduler and associated files in the registry. In reverting from W10 to W7, some of these may be have been jumbled, and some tasks from W10 that don't have an equivalent in W7 got left behind.
 The W7 Windows tasks should be recoverable from the zip file (but don't seem to be working in my case). The third-party tasks (Google, other utilities, etc.) probably need to be uninstalled and then re-installed? And, finally, the W10 tasks left behind can
 be unplugged (?) and deleted?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Rob&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Your understanding is pretty good. It is the task file that my instructions have you copy out of Windows\System32. Most task files are not modified by the Windows 10 update, and so can be reinstalled quite happily. It is the modified ones that need the Windows
 7 backup zip file. The good news is that third-party task files do not get modified by the update, because Microsoft do not understand them, and so will typically reinstall quite happily.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I hadn’t realised that you are having to go to Safe mode. I’m guessing that you’re finding that Repair Tasks fails immediately when you start it in normal mode. As you may have gathered from other threads, the most likely cause for this is problems with the
 .Net framework installation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It is excellent that you managed to get one task reinstalled. However, I am now even more puzzled that Repair Tasks does not work. I actually figured out the command line to give you by going to look at the source code of Repair Tasks to see what it does, so
 I can tell you it is doing exactly the same thing! And that error message is specific to schtasks, so I don’t see how it could be coming from any other step. I can only speculate that it is a problem with running in safe mode. I will try and reproduce it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, this does mean that you do have a way out, albeit a very tedious one. Proxy should no longer be turning up in the list of tasks with problems; and you should be able to repeat the same steps for every failing task, including the third party
 ones. If you choose to try this, remember that you need to put “” around names that contain blanks or special characters, e.g.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
schtasks /create /tn “\Microsoft\Windows\AppID\EDP Policy Manager”/xml “c:\Temp\EDP Policy Manager”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Some Microsoft tasks would also need to be taken from the zip file (you would be able to tell because of the error you get when using the existing file). You can unzip this in the normal way to get at the task files, but you will need to replace underscores
 with blanks in file names wherever they occur.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Rob &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’ve tried to reproduce your issues with Safe Mode on my test machine. I’m finding that everything I do with Repair Tasks returns the ‘network address is invalid’ error. So also does any attempt to run schtasks from the command line. This applies to both full
 safe mode, and to safe mode with networking. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, my conclusion is that Repair Tasks will not run in Safe Mode. If I could get schtasks to work, I could try and come up with some code changes that would make Repair Tasks work too , but as I can’t, I’m a bit stuck. I would say that your best bet for progress
 is to try and find out why it will not run in normal mode. The first step there is to look at the event log to see why it is failing.

&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for your investigation and follow-through. Interesting that Safe Mode may be presenting challenges to the effective running of Repair Tasks.
&lt;br&gt;

As you suggest, I will try to look into the event log and its access. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi jonwells1 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This most likely indicates that the Schedule service is not running. You can check this by opening up Task Manager, selecting the Services tab, and scrolling down to the Schedule service. Its Status should be Running, but I suspect that it is Stopped.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It has come to my attention that when the zip file is downloaded, all browsers are popping up with "this file contains a virus or malware. I just wanted to let you guys know, to see if this can be resolved.

I have also created a tutorial video on this wonderful tool. Note: I created the video for educational purpose only and take no credit in your hard work, just a way to help others.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;As far as I can tell, the malicious download warning occurs only with Chrome: IE and Edge download happily. I overrode the warnings in Chrome and verified that the downloaded file is exactly what I would expect. I also note that the problem occurs with
 both Windows 7 Tasks and Windows 8 Tasks. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
VirusTotal verifies the download pages and the files downloaded from them as clean, so this looks like a false positive with Chrome. I will try and find a way of reporting it.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;diiji, yes your program fixed &lt;a class="workItemLink" href="https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/workitem/65"&gt;65&lt;/a&gt; of my corrupted files, but would not fix all of the windows task corruptions of 31,only 20 fixed. Would the fact that my system restore will only go back to sept 8 2016 that I created and not several older ones that were
 on windows 7 before I switched over from 7 back to 10. Would this switch caused the deletion of these past restore points? Should I try the technique over again to fix the remaining 11 corrupt windows files. Now since doing these fixes my windows defrag program
 is working. Thanks for your help!!!!&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi, I have used the repair task program, many thanks, has fixed many scheduler errors. However still have 31 (registry?) errors of which the 11 above are included.
&lt;br&gt;
Can someone confirm that they are all Windows 10 specific tasks and are a result of reverting from 10 to 7. If so can I delete them to tidy things up?

No, at least some of these are standard Windows 7 tasks included in the Windows 7 Tasks zip file provided on my site. The Documentation page and the walk-through contain instructions as to how to use this. You should find that this will fix many of your remaining
 problems. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Mark &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I didn’t know I had a YouTube video. Could you post the link in this thread? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Error code 4 from backup has been seen before from time to time. It is actually returned from an underlying invocation of the xcopy command, and signifies:
&lt;br&gt;
“Initialization error occurred. There is not enough memory or disk space, or you entered an invalid drive name or invalid syntax on the command line.”
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So there might be, for instance, a problem with the target folder that you selected, or with your permission to access the folder containing the task definitions, which is \Windows\System32\Tasks. If that helps pin it down, then you can try the backup again.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Alternatively, it is generally safe to proceed to the next step without the backup, which is mostly there to guarantee that you can get back to where you started, whatever happens. In practice, it is rarely used.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Have reverted back from windows 10 to win 7 pro like many others. When I first reverted back I did mange to complete a disk image backup but then that stopped working. Ran Repair Tasks as administrator and did the scan. Running Windows in normal mode reported
 57 tasks images as being corrupted but in safe mode 117 are reported.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When I press the repair button, the message Repair Tasks has stopped working is displayed. The only option then is to close the program.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Any help would be much appreciated.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;As far as I can tell, Repair Tasks does not work in safe mode. The chances are that the reason you are getting more errors there is that everything is failing with 'network address is invalid'.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, our focus should be on normal mode. I'm hoping that there should be some record of the problem in the event log. Immediately after the failure, use the Event Viewer to have a look at the Windows Application and System logs. Do you see any likely entries
 there, and if so, what do they say? &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It worked! &lt;br&gt;
My windows 7 Home Premium (64 bit) was upgraded to Windows 10 then downgraded back to 7 Several months ago. Just found that the Task Scheduler was not working.
&lt;br&gt;
After viewing many solutions listed on the web, decided to try Repair Tasks v3.3.
&lt;br&gt;
After following your instructions (which were great!) I ran the first scan and noted 109 problems.
&lt;br&gt;
Saved the scan. Ran the Backup Tasks and it failed with &lt;strong&gt;code 4&lt;/strong&gt;. (Stopped when trying to copy a McAfee file.)
&lt;br&gt;
Made a backup copy using Windows Explorer and noted that a number of files would not copy even as Administrator.
&lt;br&gt;
Decided to try Repair and Recycle existing tasks. 77 repairs succeeded; 32 repairs failed.
&lt;br&gt;
Rerunning same result. Task Scheduler still not working. &lt;br&gt;
Tried Repair and take tasks from backup. Using your Windows7 Tasks.zip file. &lt;br&gt;
Results: 20 repairs succeeded; 12 repairs failed. Task Scheduler now working. &lt;br&gt;
Thank you! RogerM&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi RogerM &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for sharing your experience. I find it very useful to hear about what is working and what isn’t.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For backup, Repair Tasks just uses xcopy under the covers, and return code 4 from that means:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Initialization error occurred. There is not enough memory or disk space, or you entered an invalid drive name or invalid syntax on the command line.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
I wonder if it is having problems getting access to the Windows\System32\Tasks folder. Still, it sounds as though even if was getting that far, there would still be problems copying the McAfee files.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You don’t say what the 12 remaining failures are. I’m guessing that most them will be either third-party tasks e.g. ones set up by McAfee, or Windows 10 only tasks, as described in the Documentation pages. The former would probably require you to reinstall
 McAfee to sort out (with similar remedies for other third-party tasks), and Windows 10 only tasks are harmless.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Overall, it sounds like you are generally back in pretty good shape. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;font style="font-size: 11pt;"&gt;Sorry about the previous post, I was not aware that attachments were not visible.
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;font style="font-size: 11pt;"&gt;Thank you for the reply, I really appreciate people who monitor and reply to posts on their projects.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;font style="font-size: 11pt;"&gt;I tried to keep my comments short knowing there are many configurations out there.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;font style="font-size: 11pt;"&gt;I looked at the Source Code files after receiving the code 4 error because I was operating as Administrator and had lots of memory and disk space and suspected the problem maybe with
 what Command line parameters were being used with xcopy. Determined it was too much trouble and decided just to make my own backup.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;font style="font-size: 11pt;"&gt;That’s when I found that some files did not copy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;font style="font-size: 11pt;"&gt;Comparing the Repair Tasks backup with my backup I noticed that both stopped at the McAfee folder, failing to copy the McAfee file.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;font style="font-size: 11pt;"&gt;I was unable to copy the McAfee file manually, so looked at the remaining files which failed to copy and was able to copy all to my backup one at a time, leaving only the McAfee file
 not copied.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;img width="439" height="222" title="clip_image001" style="margin: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; border-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline;" alt="clip_image001" src="cid:D8E30FDD6A424568BD3365DB4D17D839@RogerLaptopPC" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;img width="439" height="250" title="clip_image002" style="border: 0px currentColor; border-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline;" alt="clip_image002" src="cid:50951DAA9DEF42A4815723BACEA83A05@RogerLaptopPC" border="0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;font style="font-size: 11pt;"&gt;That’s when I assumed the McAfee file was the problem.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;font style="font-size: 11pt;"&gt;Looked at the file properties and found that Administrator did not have full control

&lt;br&gt;
Thanks very much for the additional info. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think you are right about the permissions on the McAfee task file causing the backup problem.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And yes, 11 of those are the usual windows 10 only tasks, and the 12th is the McAfee task. So I can confirm that you are indeed in good shape. Excellent!

&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="verdana, sans-serif"&gt;I downloaded Repair Tasks &amp;amp; I don't know what choice to make in the window that appears when I open it. Please help me know what to do.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="verdana, sans-serif"&gt;Some info you may need to know: The current computer I'm using (HP Compaq Presario Notebook) was given to me by a sister. She had upgraded to Windows 10 on it and almost immediately (well before the 30th day) reverted back
 to Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1 64 bit. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="verdana, sans-serif"&gt;I can't do a backup the normal way. Thankfully, I have Norton Security Suite and it provides a backup. I backed it up onto an external storage device. Since one of the choices given by this Repair Tasks product has an option
 of "Take tasks from backup", I'm not sure how to proceed. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="verdana, sans-serif"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="verdana, sans-serif"&gt;I especially don't know what "Recycle existing tasks" means. Do I do one option, then the other? Please explain everything to me thoroughly in a step by step way. I am a complete tech dummy.

&lt;br&gt;
Your best bet is to go to the Documentation page on the Repair Tasks site, and follow the link to a walk-through that appears near the top of the page. This gives step-by-step instructions for using the utility.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi there &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm trying to run RepairTasks because things have not been working on my computer since I had Windows 10 for 10 minutes and then went back to Win7. I found this program through a thread on another webside (can't remember which) and wanted to try it out, but
 whenever I try to run the RepairTasks.exe I'm met with the standard "RepairTasks has stopped working" windows error.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Please help.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Is the crash happening before you see even the initial window? If so, then something fairly fundamental is wrong. RepairTasks deliberately depends only on things that are installed as standard in Windows 7, and the only thing that I can think of that would
 stop the initial window coming up is a problem with .Net Framework 3.5, on which RepairTasks depends. Is .Net Framework 3.5 installed? Does reinstalling it make a difference?
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Yes, that's what happens when I try to open the program, and I checked my computer for .Net Framework, and apparently I have .Net Framework 4.6.1? I don't know?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;As well as RepairTasks.exe, the zip file contains a file called RepairTasks.exe.config. Make sure that you have unzipped both files to the same directory before you try to run RepairTasks.exe.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The settings in the .config file say that it is okay to run the application with .Net Framework 4.6.1 if .Net Framework 3.5 is not available. If the .config file is not present, then .Net Framework 3.5 is required, and although this comes as part of Windows
 7, it is separately uninstallable. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note that it is perfectly okay to have multiple versions of the .Net Framework on a single system, so if the .config file doesn’t help, you might try downloading and installing .Net Framework 3.5.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let me know what happens! &lt;br&gt;

I'm having this same issue as well, on two different PC's. I have the RepairTasks.exe.config file in the AAAAATASK folder and .Net Framework 3.5 is on (as a Windows feature).

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. &lt;br&gt;

I find this very puzzling. Are you running as an administrator? Do you see the “do you want to allow this app to make changes to your PC” challenge when you start RepairTasks? Do you know if you are able to run any other .Net programs?

&lt;br&gt;
I too am having this issue. &lt;br&gt;
Currently running Windows 7 64 bit Professional. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For me, the "Stopped Responding" is occurring after scanning and finding the corrupt tasks to repair, when clicking the "repair" button is when the application is crashing.
&lt;br&gt;
I'm currently attempting to install .NET Framework 3.5 as well however mine too is enabled within the Windows Features.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Any further ideas? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I should clarify that these PC's were not reverted from Win10 to Win7. Windows Update had attempted to automatically install Win10, but those installs failed.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Task Scheduler behavior however matches what's described by all who have benefited from your tool.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I attempt to run the RepairTasks.exe as administrator, I click Yes to allow it to make changes, and then it immediately crashes saying it has stopped working.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have a screenshot of the event log entry, but am unable to paste it into this site. The Event ID is 1001 and it starts with...
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fault bucket 244346316, type 30 &lt;br&gt;
Event Name: CLR20r3 &lt;br&gt;
Response: Not available &lt;br&gt;
Cab Id: 0 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm unsure how to test the functionality of the .net framework. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi tdhosen and shanebutler &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
tdhosen’s idea of looking at the event log was a good one. Can you find anything similar, shanebutler?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m now doing exactly what you both doubtless are, hunting around the Internet. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It seems that CLR20r3 events indicate a problem with the .Net framework. Several threads point to this post:
&lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/astebner/2007/03/26/how-to-repair-the-net-framework-2-0-and-3-0-on-windows-vista/" rel="nofollow"&gt;
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/astebner/2007/03/26/how-to-repair-the-net-framework-2-0-and-3-0-on-windows-vista/&lt;/a&gt; which also applies to Windows 7 and .Net framework 3.5, which is what we are interested in.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Another angle would be to try and get some more information about the event. This post:
&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9244694/c-sharp-windows-appication-event-clr20r3-on-application-start" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9244694/c-sharp-windows-appication-event-clr20r3-on-application-start&lt;/a&gt; suggests that there are more details to be had, perhaps in the application log in the event viewer. This might help us clarify whether the problem is
 with the framework installation, or something specific to my program. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do let me know what you find! &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji and tdhosen, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have managed to get this to work on my PC. &lt;br&gt;
After searching for various means of trying to repair .NET Framework 3.5 on the PC, I attempted to do this from;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Add/Remove Windows Features" and it failed after rebooting. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attempted to do via CMD line - Failed &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have stumbled across a thread that advised that the following folder should have a heap of CONFIG files (I was missing one - The machine.config)
&lt;br&gt;
File Path; &lt;br&gt;
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\CONFIG &lt;br&gt;
I have taken a full C drive backup of my files not too long ago (within a week of this playing up) and have attempted to restore this one file from the backup&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
When replacing the file (I have a copy of the original just in case) and then running the "&lt;a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/uninstall-microsoft-net-framework-with-aaron-stebner-cleanup-tool/" rel="nofollow"&gt;.Net Framework Repair Tool&lt;/a&gt;" Steps
 (using number 3) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I was then able to run and execute the repair from RepairTask without the application crashing!!!
&lt;br&gt;
I now have another issues with Task Scheduler when it opens up, with MMC detecting an error and failing to start - But I have got this application to work on my PC now.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for your help guys! &lt;br&gt;

Thank you for taking the time to post those steps. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The PC I was working on was not missing the machine.config file from C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\CONFIG, but I did notice it had a date of 5/20/16. This PC's failed upgrade to Win10 occurred on 5/19/16 and most of the other files in that
 directory were dated back in 2009, so I'm fairly certain it had been modified as a result of the Win10 upgrade attempt. For what it's worth, the web.config file appeared to have been modified as well.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I did not have a backup copy to swap in, so I changed its name to OLD-machine.config and then tried the .net repair methods in that link you provided. No luck.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I also tried renaming the the v2.0.50727 directory to v2.0.50727-OLD and then tried uninstalling .net 3.5 (with the thought that I might then be able to force Windows to create a whole new v2.0.50727 directory with new config files by reinstalling), but the
 uninstall bombed. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It then occurred to me that .net 3.5 might be "broken" and might therefore force RepairTasks to use .net 4.61 instead. So, with the directory still named v2.0.50727-OLD, I tried re-running RepairTasks and it worked like a charm. Once I got all the
 TaskScheduler issues resolved, I renamed the directory back to v2.0.50727 and all seems well.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks again Shane for giving me the idea to mess with that directory and thanks to you Dijji for such a great tool!

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Repair Tasks immediately crashes when I try to run it in Administrator mode. I've tried all of the above without success. I experienced no problems until after the latest Windows Update on my desktop PC. I remember Windows Update trying to force me into
 Windows 10 earlier this year. Perhaps it was 5/18/2016 because that date is in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\CONFIG. After I stopped Windows from upgrading me from 7 to 10, I installed never10.exe on my laptop and my desktop. Luckily, my
 laptop didn't go through the update attempt, so it has had no problems. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I booted up in Safe Mode and Repair Tasks started up. The scan detected 91 problems, all of which had this notation - ERROR: The network address is invalid. I tried the backup zip without success. I rebooted into Safe Mode with Networking. Ran Repair Tasks
 and got the same results. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Any other ideas? Would a Windows 7 repair disk work? Is the only other option to completely reinstall Windows 7?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Tom &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am wondering whether the reason for the invalid network address problems when in safe mode is that the service with which the underlying task checking utility communicates is not running. You could have a look under the Services tab in Task Manager to see
 if the Schedule service is running. I don’t know if safe mode runs enough pieces to allow you to make repairs.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The good news however is that Repair Tasks does run, indicating that the problem in your full system is very likely to be to do with the installation of the .Net framework. The bad news is that I have no particular insight into what you can do to fix this other
 than the techniques described above. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m sorry that I can’t be of more help, but do feel free to post again as you discover more.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Thank you for taking the time to reply. I've decided the best approach is a complete Windows 7 install.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I'm very pleased with this repair tool - several errors repaired and left with three, there doesn't seem to be a problem with Task Manager any more. The three unrepaired items each returned error message "Cannot extract task file '################'

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Yes, I think it is complaining about the curly brackets in the task names. These names, by the way, are GUIDs. Creating these is the easiest way to generate a unique name. They’re usually used when tasks are set up by third-party software: for instance,
 I think Adobe Updater used to set up a task with a GUID name. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They are almost certainly not of any great importance. Should you wish to be sure, you can open up the files, which you will find in Windows\System32\Tasks, using any text reader. They are just XML, and what they do is defined by the Action tag, which normally
 appears towards the bottom of the file. &lt;br&gt;

This program counts as giving back for me. I’m already getting all I ever wanted out of it from your positive review, and your desire to reward my efforts.

I can definitely recommend the experience: contributing something that has apparently helped a lot of people feels more than fine.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;On reverting from Windows 10 to Windows 7 There were 56 corrupted tasks. Repair Tasks corrected 44 of the first pass. Another 6 were corrected by "Taking tasks from" "Windows7 Tasks.zip". The remaining 6 tasks were tasks I had defined
 with "run whether user is logged on or not" Repair of these failed with "Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password". To fix these I:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. edited the saved definitions changing "LogonType&amp;gt;Password&amp;lt;/LogonType"  to  "LogonType&amp;gt;InteractiveToken&amp;lt;/LogonType" 
2. ran "Taking tasks from"  from the backup with the editted task definitions.
3. rebooted the computer.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Rebooting was necessary because the Task Scheduler froze, probably due to my edits. I can't remember the rather cryptic message

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;When using the program, everything seems to work fine and I have gotten down to the 11 Windows 10 tasks that I should unplug, but I can't click on the unplug button. It stays faded as if I don't select a task to unplug even when I do. Know any solution
 to this?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I’m guessing that you’re looking at the results of a Scan, but Unplug is enabled only when you make a selection after a Repair. This seems a bit odd to me, too, but try running a Repair first.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Just downloaded Repair Tasks as part of clean-up after rolling back Win-10 "upgrade".
&lt;br&gt;
Completed scan, then selected 'Backup Tasks'. That returned "Task back up failed with error '4'"&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;What Backup does is to open up a command prompt and run an xcopy command to copy the contents of \Windows\System32\Tasks to a backup folder within the target folder that you select. The error code you see is the error reported by xcopy, which according
 to the Microsoft documentation means: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Initialization error occurred. There is not enough memory or disk space, or you entered an invalid drive name or invalid syntax on the command line.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You could try selecting a new target folder, or make the backup yourself from the command line or using Windows Explorer.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I have a Lenovo 1450 ABU 64-bit, running Windows 7 Home Premium SP 1 Build 7601. Just reverted back to it after trying Windows 10 (which I liked...more info later). Like other people, have problems with my scheduled backups. Found your utility, downloaded
 it, scanned it (53 problems) and got the same message as above "Task back up failed with error 4." Ran it several times with different folders. Made sure all programs such as Chrome and word processing were closed. Still received message. It runs
 VERY quickly for about 2 seconds, way too fast for me to read it, and then returns that message. I am NOT in any way knowledgeable about programming or anything other than running programs and doing tasks with them, so I don't know how to do what you suggested,
 which was "make the backup yourself from the command line or using Windows Explorer." I am positive I have enough memory (4G) (maybe that's not enough?) and disk space (180G).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am VERY tempted to just do a repair, but experience has shown that if something messes up, it will. Please let me know what else I can do.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
BTW, I did like Win10. Only problem I had was that it refused to recognize any of my USB drives, including the SD card. WASTED hours reading discussions and downloading programs, only to have no solution, so if you or someone else could come up with a solution,
 I and others would be grateful. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And, Dijji, you are a refreshing drink of water in all this crap. As I said above, so much time has been wasted running solutions from people who ought to know how to fix the problem. It sounds as if you really know what you're doing!
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thank you for the kind words - but I haven’t fixed your problems yet. Here’s how to backup your tasks manually.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a folder in which you are going to save a copy of your tasks. This can be anywhere, for instance in My Documents.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Windows Explorer, open Windows\System32\Tasks (on your Windows system drive). You may be told that you don’t have access to this folder, and be asked whether you want to grant permission. If so, say yes.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select the entire contents of the Tasks folder, including all the folders that it contains. Right click and choose Copy.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the folder which you created in step 1, right click and choose Paste.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
These steps will create exactly the same backup as one created by Repair Tasks. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you have any problems with this, or run into further problems, feel free to post again.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi CPL949&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you, that gives me a pretty strong pointer to what is going on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When you install a task, the system takes the provided detailed definition of the task (which is an XML file), and copies it to \System 32\Tasks, or one of its subfolders. If the definition is already present in \System 32\Tasks, the installation fails, which
 is what you are seeing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What Repair Tasks does is to reinstall a task. It does this by copying the existing definition from \System 32\Tasks, and then removing it from the system folder so that it can be installed again. If that installation fails, Repair Tasks puts the definition
 back where it was. Early versions deleted the original in the system folder, having copied it, but this ran into problems because some antivirus packages allowed the deletion, but prevented the restoration, causing task definitions to be lost. So, the current
 version renames the copy in \System 32\Tasks, adding "._hidden_" to its name, to get it out of the way, then renames it back again if the installation fails, or deletes it if it succeeds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In your case, my guess is that your antivirus or some other protection is inhibiting the rename, so that the repair fails with ‘file exists’. What antivirus software are you running? Can you try running the repair again with your antivirus temporarily disabled?
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I’ve been looking at the code, trying to imagine what could be going on, but I can’t see how any other problem could generate the error that you are seeing.
&lt;br&gt;
It might shed some light to try part of the process manually. Take the following steps:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In File Explorer, go to \System32\Tasks. You should find a file there called ‘GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore’. Rename it to ‘GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore._hidden_’.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open Repair Tasks and run Scan. If you then look in \System32\Tasks, you should find that both ‘GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore’ and ‘GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore._hidden_’ are now present.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If this is the case, run Repair with recycle existing tasks selected. Do you see any change in the result for this task? If you look in \System32\Tasks, you should find that only ‘GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore’ is now present.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
If you have a chance, try this and let me know what you find. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Sorry for the delay...I was kind of busy for the last couple of days. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you, Dijji, for all your time and expertise in helping me with this problem.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First, I did rename the file. They are both there in the Tasks folder. However, when I ran scan, it did NOT show up. I typed the name as
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore.&lt;em&gt;hidden&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Did not use your quotes or end period. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If that is not the correct way to type the name, please let me know, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
BTW, I don't know if it makes any difference, but I cannot find that system32 file by file explorer. I have to go directly to the folder on the C: drive.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          <Html>
        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I think you got that right, the name should be: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore._hidden_ &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There is some potential confusion, because Codeplex markup uses underscores to indicate italics (as in your post).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m confused by your ‘both’. Before the rename, you should have just GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore, and after it just GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore._hidden_
&lt;br&gt;
if that’s the case, you’re saying you still have just GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore._hidden_ after having run Scan?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Back then, after running Scan on recycle...yes, the file with the hidden name was there along with the regular file. Now, however, it is not there (the file with hidden).&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Looking at the errors, they seem to be coming from the step where RepairTasks invokes Schtasks.exe to reinstall the tasks. The access denied errors are definitely coming from this step. RepairTasks executes this step in a subprocess, which should be picking
 up the same privileges as its parent, but the errors are consistent with the subprocess not having admin privileges, for some unobvious reason.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think that in your case the best diagnostic approach might be to pick one of the tasks and go through the steps manually, as documented here:
&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/2305420" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/2305420&lt;/a&gt; and see where, if anywhere, things go astray.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Alright, while that procedure didn't fix the problem for me it led me to the solution. Basically what I discovered when I started interrogating the individual task keys in regedit is that, while I had control of the HK_LM, the ownership and permissions
 had been cleared on the specific subkeys for each of the Microsoft tasks in TaskCache. What I had to do was go through, one by one because for some reason child propagation of ownership was not working on them, and take ownership of each subkey then assign
 permissions to it from MACHINE. This allowed me to clear them completely and then RepairTasks was able to rebuild the cache from the existing XMLs in System32/Tasks. Once that was done, I checked TaskScheduler, and all appeared correct, no errors and the system
 control panel that originally started me on this journey gave no errors on changing settings for system restore. I have no idea what could have cleared / damaged those permissions, but I'm going to cross my fingers and hope that other surprises aren't hiding
 for me somewhere else in the registry. Thanks for creating this tool, Dijji. You really saved my behind here.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thank you so much for creating and posting this tool. I was struggling after a failed Win 10 upgrade and rollback to Win 7. Like so many others here.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
All of my corrupted tasks were fixed except for one. I tried "Recycle existing tasks" and "Take tasks from backup".
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For Recycle existing tasks it says "Cannot copy task file 'C:\windows\system32\Tasks\Adobe Acrobat Update Task', The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error.".
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And for tasks from backup it said that it does not exist in the backup. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Any ideas on what I should do next? I have unplugged it. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for any help!&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The good news is that you are already in entirely acceptable shape. The task concerned is added by Adobe when you install one of their products, to make periodic checks for updates. So, leaving it in its current unplugged state should give you no problems.
 It is not in the zip file because it is not part of any Microsoft Windows release; if you would like to restore it, probably the easiest way is to repair or reinstall some Adobe software.

I have a problem machine though that still has 3 tasks that are unable to be repaired. Here is the log

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Nasty, but much clearer. These are all tasks that are triggered by system events, and it is complaining that it cannot set up the query over the event database.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A good cross check would be to open up the Event Viewer, and see if you can read the Application log.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One possibility is that the Event Log Service is not running, for some reason. See this thread:
&lt;a href="http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/116954-45-event-service-missing" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/116954-45-event-service-missing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Another possibility is that the registration or content of a system DLL required by the Task Scheduler to set up the query has been corrupted, in which case re-registration or “SFC /scannow” may help.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But check the health of the Event Log Service first. &lt;br&gt;

Anyone that has this issue with event services failing to start error 3 navigate to windows\system32\winevt, check and see if there is a folder called logs. If there is not create the folder and then start the service. Presto it starts, then run the task repair
 tool again and it will work. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It’s good to hear that you’ve cracked the problems, and how. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
From my point of view, it’s also worth noting that errors reported by Repair, if they are not variations on “file not found” or the same as the error that occurs during Scan, may be pointing to an underlying problem with the system that is causing the issues.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The app didn't work for me. There should be a disclaimer that you need to know and have a backup of your (good) tasks.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Additionally, I did back up the corrupted tasks (more than 50) before deleting them. Now, if I wanted to, how to do I load the backed up zip file?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Could you be a little bit more detailed about what didn’t work?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also, note that Repair Tasks strongly suggests taking a backup before making any changes and, if the user agrees, will actually make a backup of your tasks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you do agree, you get to select a target folder, which defaults to My Documents, and in that folder Repair Tasks creates a copy of all task files in a subfolder named “Tasks yyyy-mm-dd hhmmss” , where yyyy et cetera is the current date and time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can use that subfolder as the source for a Repair with ‘Take tasks from backup’ selected to reapply the backed up tasks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you backed up your tasks in some other way (your post isn’t clear on this), then the answer depends on exactly what you backed up and how. Also, I’m a little unclear about what you deleted, as Repair Tasks never actually deletes a task: at most it will Unplug
 them, i.e. delete registry entries used by Task Scheduler.&lt;br&gt;

Upon discovering that my PC had a Task Scheduler problem, I began to search for a solution, when very shortly after i came across the links to your software, and after carefully reading the walk-through documentation, and familiarizing myself with the repair
 procedure, i began to execute the repair, and wouldn't you know it, everything went just as planned... no errors, and the Task that were left in an unplugged state, were just as stated.

Again i Thank You for your hard work and dedication.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
At least some of those task names look familiar. They should be fixable using Windows 7 Tasks.zip, as described in the walk-through, and in the Documentation tab towards the bottom of the page.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you continue to have trouble, please save the output from a Repair attempt, and copy and paste it into this thread.

&lt;br&gt;
Dijji or anyone else, can you shed some light on this? I am in desperation mode at this point and ready to give up... Been dealing with this for weeks and hoping someone has a solution&amp;gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi vicosab &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
An immediate way forward would be to unplug the failing task by selecting it after a Scan and pressing ‘Unplug Task’. This will remove it from the sight of Task Scheduler, which should then work normally.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You don’t lose anything by doing this, because the task definition file will remain in System32\Tasks, and can still be reinstalled using RepairTasks, not that there would be any reason to do so.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Going to the next level, I’m wondering what the source of this task was. Is “Backup file folder" it’s full name i.e. is it in the root of the task folders? If so, it suggests that it was either created manually, or set up by a non-Microsoft supplied tool.
 You could look in the task definition file itself: it is just XML, look for the Actions element to see what it does, and whether you care that it currently doesn’t.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Unplugged the failing task and everything is now running perfectly! Creating a new task or a basic task now loads up correctly and can go into my tasks library without a problem... "Backup file folder" was the name of a Synctoy task I created to backup
 some folders to an external drive and set it echo everyday. So that name was something I created as a name of a task and not a root folder...
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I can't thank you enough for your help and MAJOR KUDOS for creating this app to fix the Task Scheduler! you can write apps for me anytime!&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;You are going to need a ‘Windows 8.1 Tasks.zip’, similar to the Windows 7 file already available for download.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I will see if I can get hold of a clean Windows 8.1 system, and if so, I will extract the task configurations and post the zip file required.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;That took less time than I thought. I have added a separate download ‘Windows8.1 Tasks.zip ‘which contains task definition files for Windows 8.1. This is to be used in exactly the same way as Windows7 Tasks.zip is used when reverting to Windows 7, as described
 in the Documentation tab. &lt;br&gt;

Please give it a go and let me know what you find. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It sounds as though the restored task is not running correctly because it has not got correct login information set up, so unplug the existing task and recreate in Syncback Pro looks like a good option. This may overwrite the existing task definition file,
 but may run into trouble because the old task definition, although unplugged and therefore invisible to Task Scheduler, still exists. In this case, you will need to go into System32\Tasks and delete the old Syncback Pro task definition before recreating it.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Is the file that you are trying to unzip RepairTasks.zip? That’s the download that includes the executable. If that is the file, the most likely problem is a corrupt download, so try downloading a fresh copy.

I have mentioned this on your issues tab but include it here in case I was in the wrong place!!

The 'not installed' are as you have said, Win 10 related and so do not matter. The remaining five however, despite several repeats of the process do not correct? I am using a zipped file from the backup but still no success. Do you have any suggestion of what
 might be the problem? &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Malcolm &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Discussions are probably more effective, because I don’t seem to be getting notified when anybody creates an issue, so I’m afraid I didn’t see yours.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But, looking at the output that you uploaded with the issue, the five tasks in question should be being fixed using Windows 7 Tasks.zip. I notice that the five tasks are all ones with a space somewhere in their path or name. This leads me to wonder whether
 you have unzipped Windows 7 Tasks.zip after downloading it, because that will give you names with underscores where blanks should be. The easiest way to avoid this problem is to point at the downloaded zip file itself when asked for the source of the backup
 task files. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If this doesn’t help, could you post the output from a failed Repair run on this thread please?
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji! I was having the same problem with the Task Scheduler but not because of a win10 downgrade. somehow I got this problem because of system restore or failed win10 upgrade I think
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Actually I was planning on upgrading to win10 so I made sure I had everything I needed and I kinda over ccompensated. I think thats how my pc got messed up so then I decided to run system restore. the first few attempts were okay but then recently it all just
 failed. I tried to check my task scheduler for some reason then I got the corrupt pop-ups.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Well thanks to your software I had most of them fixed but theres still 31 left. I was hoping if you could help me fix this problem. I followed the steps correctly but still no use huhu can you please help me.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
and I would also like to ask for your help with regards to my win10 update. The regular promp of the update disappeared that why I check the task scheduler to try and run it. how do I upgrade now?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi christiangrey &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Windows 10 upgrade does not depend on the task scheduler at all, it comes entirely through Windows Update. System Restore will rollback these updates, and it sounds like you may have rolled back some important ones. The first thing to do is to run Windows Update,
 and check for updates repeatedly until it tells you that no important updates are available.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If having done this, you still have problems with the task scheduler, if you save the results from Scan and Repair and post them on this thread, I will try to help further.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I’m sorry to be so slow replying to this, Codeplex was having trouble sending email notifications of posts for a while, and I must have missed this one.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Most of these problems can be fixed using the Windows7 Tasks.zip download, as described towards the bottom of the documentation page and in steps 3 and 10 onwards of the walk-through. The most common error here is that it is important to select the zip file
 itself in the open folder dialog that comes up, and not the folder containing the zip file.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If this does not fix the problems, leaving you just 11 ‘Task not installed’ tasks, which can be safely left alone, as described in the documentation
&lt;a href="http://repairtasks.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Windows%2010%20only%20tasks&amp;amp;referringTitle=Documentation" rel="nofollow"&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt;, please post the log from the Repair using the zip file. &lt;br&gt;

Again, I salute you. Now, I'll try the defrag and see if all is well. More later. Again, Thanks.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Windows 7 Tasks.zip is a download from my site. You can find it as the second item down on the Downloads page. Once you have this, put it into a known folder, like My Documents, and follow the instructions.

I am a klutz but is there another way to attempt to fix this? one time after the scan an fix, the 5 seemed to indicate improper code. A long string. no cure&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It is best not to unzip the downloaded Windows 7 Tasks.zip file. Just copy it to a known folder from your downloads folder, then point at it when prompted during Repair. You should be seeing something like

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I’m sorry to have been slow responding: I’ve been migrating my main system to a new machine, and, guess what, things didn’t go entirely smoothly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But I have given a good deal of thought to your request. The question of how far it makes sense for me to go in trying to help is an important one. I think that the line for me turns out to be in taking on partial ownership of somebody else’s system. To put
 that in other terms, if I got an email telling me that somebody’s system was hosed, would I feel obliged to take all steps necessary to put things right, because I could have been part of the cause of the problem? I think that’s why Repair Tasks doesn’t have
 just one button saying ‘Fix It’, but demands that its users participate in the process. There are too many variables, and I can’t see a way to write code that would do the right thing in all circumstances, because I don’t know what all the possible circumstances
 are.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, I can’t go as far as taking your system over remotely. But I will continue to explain your situation and help you move forward. Could you post the errors that you are currently getting from Repair?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The tasks reported as ‘Task not installed’ are Windows 10 only tasks, and can be safely left alone, as described in the documentation
&lt;a href="http://repairtasks.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Windows%2010%20only%20tasks&amp;amp;referringTitle=Documentation" rel="nofollow"&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The tasks reported as ‘Task image corrupt’ should be fixed using the Windows7 Tasks.zip download as described in steps 3 and 10 onwards. The most common error here is that it is important to select the zip file itself in the open folder dialog that comes up,
 and not the folder containing the zip file. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If this does not fix the problems, leaving you just 11 ‘Task not installed’ tasks, please post the log from the failed Repair.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Worked like a charm, fixed all but 4 on the first pass then those i fixed from the Windows 7 tasks zip. As for Microsoft fixing this not going to happen their plan is to get everyone on Windows 10 at any cost.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The problems shown in the Repair log that you give are all because of Task Files that contain task specifications that are not valid for Windows 7. Quite a few of them should be fixed by downloading and using the Windows 7 Tasks zip file, as described in the
 walk-through. Those remaining should be the 11 listed in the documentation as Windows 10 only tasks.
&lt;br&gt;

If any other errors remain, please let me know. &lt;br&gt;

Thank you for the quick reply. I will try the Windows 7 Tasks file. As for the UnPlug and Backup Buttons. I can see on the documentation page the buttons near the bottom but I my version these buttons are not there, I could send you a screen shot to show these
 buttons are not there. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi RWBA50&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since it seems that you can see the Save Results button, it doesn’t look as though the form is being truncated. This makes me wonder about whether you are really running 3.3. You can check by going to the executable in Explorer, using right click to look at
 its Properties, and looking at the Details tab. The version should begin with 3.3.5805.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the missing tasks, when prompted for the folder containing the backup tasks, you need to select the zip file itself, and not the folder containing the zip file. If the zip file does not contain the task, the log entry looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Zip file 'C:\Users\Dijji\Documents\Windows7 Tasks.zip' does not contain task file 'Microsoft\Windows\Bluetooth\UninstallDeviceTask2'&lt;br&gt;

You were right about the version, don't know how since I downloaded the zip file from the codeplex site but somehow I had version 1.0 installed. I have since run version 3.3. and restored the tasks from Window 7 Tasks zip file and things look good with only
 the 11 WIN 10 tasks remaining. Thanks for all of your help. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;So close yet so far! Yet another 'W10 decided to install itself' user. Did not accept licence agreement and so backed out without use. All seemed well until I tried changing my restore point settings. Repair Tasks' sorted out many issues and left 11. However,
 I can't get Windows7 tasks to work as the ZIP is not displayed and so can't be selected. And if I point Repair Tasks at an extracted directory I get:

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The good news is that you are already done. The tasks that you are left with are the Windows 10 only tasks described in the documentation
&lt;a href="http://repairtasks.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Windows%2010%20only%20tasks&amp;amp;referringTitle=Documentation" rel="nofollow"&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt; and can be safely left alone. &lt;br&gt;

I don’t know why you can’t see the zip file, but happily, you don’t need it. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;If you look towards the bottom of the Documentation page, it tells you how to use the Windows7 Tasks zip file that you can download from my site. This should address the tasks reported as “Task image corrupt” in the first list that you give.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also towards the bottom of the same page is a link to a list of the Windows 10 only tasks, which need not be recovered and can be left alone. These are the tasks reported as “Task not installed” in that same list.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you have any problems left that are not either fixed by the zip file, or listed as Windows 10 only, please let me know.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thank you! This program worked for me after I rolled back Windows 10 to Windows 7 on a Dell XPS. Windows 10 had been buggy and slow with lockups/freezes.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I had multiple "corrupt" task files. This program fixed all but 12 tasks that matched a list on this website of Windows 10 tasks that remain unplugged and can be ignored. I had previously tried several other remedies on other websites to no avail.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kudos to the developer(s)! Thankfully he/they did what Microsoft should be doing.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi! So, I am very interested in downloading your software, as I unfortunately fell into the Windows 10 trap, also. I went back to my Windows 7 (64 bit). However, I am running Norton 360 antivirus on my laptop, and it keeps removing the file every time
 I try to download it. Do I force it to restore the file, or shut off the antivirus completely (which I don't really want to do) in order to download it?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I tried to load 10 and did not make a backup of my system, except for important data. The backup failed, was finally able to reload 7 but have had nothing but problems since. Your program fixed &lt;a class="workItemLink" href="https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/workitem/138"&gt;138&lt;/a&gt; issues but could not fix &lt;a class="workItemLink" href="https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/workitem/32"&gt;32&lt;/a&gt; issues. Please do not think
 I am complaining. I could not back up the system, defrag etc., etc, etc.. I was at the point of reinstalling win 7 pro. That would have been a real headache. I am not comfortable with editing the register, so when I came across your program and it worked I
 was ecstatic. &lt;br&gt;
If possible I would your opinion on the remaining 32 issues. I do not see a button to attach, so included is an image of the print out. (Had to do a copy past)
&lt;br&gt;
Again, thank you for this gift. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Quite a few of these are in the Windows tasks zip file that you can download from my site: its use is described towards the bottom of the Documentation page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Some more are amongst the Windows 10 only tasks, also mentioned in the Documentation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These should cover most of your remaining issues. You should be able to get it down to the only non-Microsoft supplied task in your list, the McAfee task. Repairing the McAfee installation may sort this out.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let me know if you finish up with any unexpected failures. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I will be rereading the documentation and the other threads were people used the win task zip. When I download the program I received two folders, and a list of the 32 failed repairs. I also get a "Task backup failed with error "4" when

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I notice that some of the remaining tasks with a problem are in the zip file but have a blank somewhere in their path or file name. Is it possible that you unzipped the zip file rather than repairing from it directly? If so, you may be falling foul of
 the fact that names in the zip file have blanks replaced with underscores, in order to make them valid URLs, as required by this form of zip file. This means that unzipping the file will leave tasks with blanks with the wrong names. If you repair from the
 zip file without first unzipping it, the code fixes the names automatically for you.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
With luck, this should get you to the point where you have just 11 Windows 10 only tasks left unrepaired, which can be safely left alone.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thanks so much for creating this tool! I started with 106 invalid tasks. The first repair cycle fixed &lt;a class="workItemLink" href="https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/workitem/75"&gt;75&lt;/a&gt; of them.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Gomtuu &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I observe that the log you supply is trying to repair the remaining tasks using the backup copy of your tasks, which of course fail for the original reasons.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, you’re right in saying that all the five tasks giving you trouble are in the zip file. I notice that one thing they have in common is that each has a blank somewhere in its path or its file name. Is it possible that you unzipped the zip file rather
 than repairing from it directly? If so, you may be falling foul of the fact that names in the zip file have blanks replaced with underscores, in order to make them valid URLs, as required by this form of zip file. This means that unzipping the file will leave
 tasks with blanks with the wrong names. If you repair from the zip file without first unzipping it, the code fixes the names automatically for you.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If that doesn’t work, please let me have the log of what happens when you repair using the zip file.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thanks for the prompt reply Dijji. You are correct. I did unzip the file first and that was the source of my problem. Repairing directly from the zip file resolved the problems. Thanks again.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Very interesting. Thanks for sending this list in. I have looked at these in some detail (see below), and they all appear to be Windows 10 tasks with no Windows 7 equivalent. The appropriate action in RepairTasks is therefore to unplug these tasks so that
 they do not interfere with Task Scheduler. None of them showed up when I reverted from an upgrade to the original version of Windows 10, so I speculate that they may have been introduced by the November refresh.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have found all of them on a Windows 10 1511 system of my own. Below, for each task, I give the description shown in Task Scheduler, and the executable that implements their action. For most of them, Task Scheduler merely shows ‘Custom Handler’, and won’t
 give you any more detail than that. But if you look in the XML file, it gives a GUID that leads via the registry to a DLL implementing the action, which is what I list.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Almost none of the executables implementing the actions appear on a Windows 7 system, which is pretty good evidence that the tasks did not exist. The only exception is System32\srchadmin.dll, which is used by Microsoft\Windows\Shell\IndexerAutomaticMaintenance.
 However, the earliest references that I can find to this task are from Windows 8; I think that the Windows 7 indexing service was not supported by such a task.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft\Windows\AppID\EDP Policy Manager &lt;br&gt;
This task performs steps necessary to configure Enterprise Data Protection &lt;br&gt;
System32\AppLockerCsp.dll&lt;br&gt;
I think that this feature was added in Windows 10&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft\Windows\AppID\SmartScreenSpecific &lt;br&gt;
Task that collects data for SmartScreen in Windows.&lt;br&gt;
system32\apprepsync.dll&lt;br&gt;
Windows 8 introduced SmartScreen filtering at the desktop level, performing reputation checks by default on any file or application downloaded from the Internet&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft\Windows\CertificateServicesClient\AikCertEnrollTask &lt;br&gt;
This task enrolls a certificate for Attestation Identity Key.&lt;br&gt;
system32\ngctasks.dll&lt;br&gt;
See &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn410314.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn410314.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft\Windows\CertificateServicesClient\CryptoPolicyTask &lt;br&gt;
This task synchronizes cryptographic policy.&lt;br&gt;
system32\ngctasks.dll&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft\Windows\CertificateServicesClient\KeyPreGenTask &lt;br&gt;
This task pre-generates TPM based Attestation Identity Key (AIK) and Storage Key (SK).&lt;br&gt;
system32\ngctasks.dll&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft\Windows\Location\WindowsActionDialog &lt;br&gt;
Location Notification&lt;br&gt;
System32\WindowsActionDialog.exe&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft\Windows\MemoryDiagnostic\RunFullMemoryDiagnostic &lt;br&gt;
Detects and mitigates problems in physical memory (RAM).&lt;br&gt;
System32\MemoryDiagnostic.dll&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft\Windows\Shell\FamilySafetyMonitor &lt;br&gt;
Initialises Family Safety monitoring and enforcement.&lt;br&gt;
System32\wpcmon.exe&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft\Windows\Shell\FamilySafetyRefresh &lt;br&gt;
Synchronises the latest settings with the Family Safety website.&lt;br&gt;
System32\WpcWebSync.dll&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft\Windows\Shell\IndexerAutomaticMaintenance &lt;br&gt;
Keeps the search index up to date&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I am not very computer literate, but I have managed to use the downloads for "Repair Tasks" to fix approx 53 of the tasks. I still have 16 tasks that show up when I run the Task Repair Scan. All 11 of the Windows 10 tasks are listed and there
 are 5 others that have "the task image is corrupt or has been tampered with".
&lt;br&gt;
In order of Task Scheduler: &lt;br&gt;
Task UsbCeip &lt;br&gt;
Task Kernel Ceip Task &lt;br&gt;
Task Analyse System &lt;br&gt;
Task Synchronize Time &lt;br&gt;
Task Queue Reporting &lt;br&gt;
I would like to clean this up, because I, like many others, had Win 10 upgrade and then reverted back to Win 7Pro 64bit. I'm not sure where to go to delete the Win 10 tasks and I am not confident in repairing the above listed tasks. Any HELP would be greatly
 appreciated! &lt;br&gt;
Thanks, Paul (pjwdesigngm) &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Paul &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The five tasks that you list all appear to be standard Windows 7 tasks (I think that the names you give are their displayable names rather than their official names, which don’t have blanks and are not affected by language e.g. ‘Analyse System’ is formally
 AnalyzeSystem). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So you should be able to clear all these up using the ‘Windows7 Tasks.zip’ download that I provide and following the steps described in the documentation, which I repeat here for your convenience:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To use standard Windows 7 task files, download the Windows7 Tasks.zip file, then Repair with the ‘Take tasks from backup’ radio button checked. In the dialog that opens, select the Windows7 Tasks.zip file in its downloaded location. For each task to be repaired,
 RepairTasks looks inside the zip file for the corresponding task file from a clean Windows 7 installation. If there is one, it uses it to repair the task; otherwise the task is left unchanged. It is not necessary to unzip the downloaded file
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do let me know if you have any problems. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji &lt;br&gt;
I first want to Thank You for the solution so generously given. I have another computer that ran Win 7Pro 64bit, so I went into the Systems 32/ Tasks and searched for the 5 that were corrupt, made a copy of each and put them in a folder. Then, I moved the folder
 to a USB drive and cut and paste the folder to the computer with the 5 corrupted tasks. Ran "Fix Task Scheduler". Scan showed 5 corrupt Tasks, as expected, went to "Use Back Up" selected the folder I had copied from my other computer. And,
 Voila, came back as "recovered". Opened Task Scheduler and NO error messages. Thank You, again for your expertise on this matter caused by Win 10 to Win 7 rollback.
&lt;br&gt;
Have a Great and Prosperous New Year!&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Dijji - Thank you for the files. I was a bit confused and it took me a while to understand how to use the tools, so I took the time to show what I did to fix the problem in a step by step manner. THANK you again for creating these wonderful tools to solve
 this issue. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fixed in 14 steps. See below. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue was Caused by reverting from Windows 10 back to Windows 7 (in my case windows 7 64 Bit)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download Repair Tasks by Dijji at &lt;a href="https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;
https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download Windows7 Tasks.zip (DO NOT UNZIP) at &lt;a href="https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/releases/view/617575?RateReview=true" rel="nofollow"&gt;
https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/releases/view/617575?RateReview=true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a Folder called AAAAATASK in your Documents (Which can be found START &amp;gt; Documents)&lt;br&gt;
C:\Users\David\Documents\AAAAATASK&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open the downloaded RepairTasks.zip file From step 2 and copy both files (RepairTaskes.exe and RepairTasks.exe.config to the AAAAATASK folder in your documents folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy the entire downloaded zip file Windows7 Tasks.zip to the AAAAATASK folder in your documents folder.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right click and Run as administrator RepairTaskes.exe &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click the Scan Button to get list of corrupted files &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click the repair Button. (most or all of the tasks should be repaired now. If not, go to step 10.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click the Radio button&amp;gt; Take tasks from backup &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click Scan for a list of the remaining corrupted files. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click Repair again. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will get a pop-up window asking where the RepairTasks.zip is located-- the file you created AAAAATASK, which should be on the very top – of course, as reason for the name of the file.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can test by running Both Scans and if you do not get anymore lists of files. Boom! You are done.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
If I missed a step, please let me know, and I will post with the corrections.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Norwood451 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You give a good walk-through of what I think is a typical experience of using RepairTasks. With your permission, I think I would like to add it to the documentation. The only thing I find slightly surprising is the recommendation to use ‘Run as Administrator’,
 rather than just running the program and being prompted to authorise it to run as administrator. Do you have a particular reason for this?
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji – First, thank you for the free Software, without it I would have had to reinstall Windows 7.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yes, of course you can use my walk-through, I owe you anyway. I added a step, just now.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My system requires administrator approval, so I added that in case someone else systems also does. It will not hurt to do so no matter what, as you know.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I just wrote down steps that I did and because I am not a programmer, so it may be easier for a layman to understand. However, I was a copy writer for technical manuals and brochures in my past vocation, so it should be accurate based on my experience.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can certainly make changes if you want. It's your program. However feel free to give me credit. :) - BTW- I am a Real Estate Broker on the Central Coast of California.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I cannot thank you enough for the help your download has provided. I thought I was lame because I went back to Windows 7 after trying Windows 10. I never knew so many others did the same. But I was totally unaware that it also messed up my computer. Even
 after I ran the download I still could not back up but with the help of your blog, specifically Stu's tip to try each library individually, I solved the problem and I am backing up as I type this. Thank you again.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello Dijji &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I thought to myself new year new OS as it kept popping up in the corner saying "here I am and Im free!" (Are we Beta bunnies?)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Like so many others I was having problems after down grading from windows 10, my main problem with 10 being graphics card issues with "nvlddmkm stop start TDR's" and black screens. The whole experience has taken a small chunk of my life trying to
 get my head around it. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Having thrown in the towel and reverting back to windows 7, like &lt;strong&gt;SO&lt;/strong&gt; many others
&lt;br&gt;
Im finding myself with a different bunch of problems with the Task Scheduler "&lt;strong&gt;The task image is corrupt or has been tampered with" (0x80041321)&lt;/strong&gt;" issue. Which after trawling
&lt;br&gt;
the internet has led me to your site and your dedecated efforts to devise a work around solutuion for something Microsoft should have nipped in the bud last year.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On finding I was not alone in my Woe's you web page has come as a relief on the road back to a stable Windows 7. I installed your program and it came up with some 130 errors.
&lt;br&gt;
After downloading your windows 7 tasks zip folder and clicking repair using the take task from backup it fixed a whole heap of stuff leaving me with just 11 tasks outstanding.
&lt;br&gt;
I read on your Documentation page &lt;br&gt;
" There are also tasks added in more recent versions of Windows 10 that run code that does not exist at all in Windows 7, and therefore can be left unrepaired and unplugged,
&lt;br&gt;
or removed from the system by deleting the task files." &lt;br&gt;
I went into the scheduler and followed the routes to the outstanding tasks and deleted what I thought were the related tasks.
&lt;br&gt;
I stopped to go back and check and now I have 13 issues and have a few like this &lt;br&gt;
"Task Microsoft\Windows\AppID\EDP Policy Manager reported 'ERROR: The system cannot find the path specified."
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am happy that I have got this far but still have a little way to go as I still can't create a backup, im recieving Error code 0x81000031.
&lt;strong&gt;Can you help?&lt;/strong&gt; I can provide the aftermath text if it helps? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I like so many others here really apprieciate what you are doing and can not thank you enough. Some one did mention a donate button? Keep up the good work
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Many thanks Stu&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Stu &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think that my documentation has led you astray: I’ve updated it already. When you reached the point at which you had just the 11 Windows 10 tasks left, you were actually in good shape, and it should have been possible to set up backup. When my documentation
 said that you could ‘delete the task files’, it should have made it clear that it meant the files defining the tasks that are held under\System32\Tasks, because, at that point, the tasks are not registered with the Task Scheduler, and so could not have been
 deleted using it. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It follows that, when you deleted tasks using Task Scheduler, you must have been deleting healthy tasks with similar names instead. So now, the problem is to put them back. One helpful source might be the task files that you backed up, if you obey the prompts,
 when you started to use RepairTasks. If you let me know what the log from the Scan reports, and what errors you see when you start Task Scheduler, I can try and give you more specific advice.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After growing weary a hole can be dug deeper right? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I ran the Task file back up which repaired two of the errors and got me back down to the 11.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In Task Scheduler I imported the tasks that I accidentally deleted from your Windows 7 zip and that repaired the 'ERROR: The system cannot find the path specified."
&lt;br&gt;
issue. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is now the log from the Scan result &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Task not installed: Microsoft\Windows\AppID\EDP Policy Manager &lt;br&gt;
Task not installed: Microsoft\Windows\AppID\SmartScreenSpecific &lt;br&gt;

Task not installed: Microsoft\Windows\Time Synchronization\ForceSynchronizeTime &lt;br&gt;
Scan completed: 11 problems found &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On Starting Task Scheduler I don't have any errors now. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On the Check Backup "pop up window" it details: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Windows Backup failed while determining libraries location of one of the users included in backup.
&lt;br&gt;
Details: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Backup time;1/27/2016 4.39 pm &lt;br&gt;
Backup Location: LaCie (I:) &lt;br&gt;
Error code: 0x91000031 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I had a look in the Scheduler and AutomaticBackup (last run succeeded 1/27/2016 4:19:59 PM) which is confusing me a little.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On another note: I recently deleted a partition and reformatted the LaCie hard-drive , not sure if that's relevant ?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Stu &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It looks like your tasks are in now in good shape, and can be left in their current state.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The backup problem is almost certainly unrelated. Best bet is a nasty little gotcha with libraries. If you go to the folders under Libraries, such as Pictures, right click and say Properties, it will display a list of Library Locations, which is the set of
 places conflated to form the library. A common cause of this problem is that a location has crept into one of these lists which is no longer accessible, such as the smartcard on a camera that was plugged in at some point, but no longer is. Check each of the
 library folders. Problem locations tend to have strange names, so it should be possible to spot the rogue, then you can just remove it from the list in the properties dialog.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let me know if this does not work. &lt;br&gt;

You where correct in that the location had a folder with a strange name! Im not sure if the link image is attached

&lt;br&gt;
I cracked it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I went through this process:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
a) Open Backup and Restore. Make sure to select “Change settings” in the backup and restore window.&lt;br&gt;
b) Select the drive you wish to use for the backup.&lt;br&gt;
c) Now, select “Let me choose” before clicking Next.&lt;br&gt;
d) From the list, uncheck all the pre- selected libraries and uncheck “Include System Image”, switch off everything.&lt;br&gt;
e) Switch on one library at time and started back up, if it backs up fine, cancel backup and go through process
&lt;br&gt;
(a to d) and added a library one at a time, repeating the process until it wouldn't back up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I found that a folder which was linked to the video library used to have some films in was no longer there, so deleted the entry from the videos library.&lt;br&gt;
It is now happily backing up and the problem appears to be solved, thank you once again for your help, problem solved.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Keep up the good work&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And once again thank you &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I can only discover one Bluetooth related task on my Windows 10 system: Microsoft\Windows\Bluetooth\UninstallDeviceTask. You can stop this task being repaired by RepairTasks by going to \Windows\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\Bluetooth\ and removing
 the UninstallDeviceTask file, for instance by moving it to another folder. With luck, this should allow you to repair the other tasks without upsetting Bluetooth.

Thank you for the quick response. Unfortunately, that task was not the problem...bluetooth stopped working. I was hoping that I could restore my original task schedules by simply copying and pasting from my backup to \Windows\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\Bluetooth\,
 but that didn't work. I even tried deleting the entire contents of \Windows\System32\Tasks, but bluetooth still wouldn't work. I had to do a system restore to get it working again. How do I do a restore of backed up tasks?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: rgb(53, 28, 117); font-family: tahoma,sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;
By doing repairs in batches, I have narrowed down the problem to one of the following tasks...any suggestions on which ones might be the problem? Thanks for your help.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;RepairTasks works by scanning for task files under System32\Tasks, and will attempt to repair anything that it finds there that is not currently a correctly installed task. So, to restore tasks from a backup, just copy the task files in their folder structure
 from the backup to System32\Tasks, and run RepairTasks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the tasks that you list, they are all non-Microsoft provided tasks. I only recognise two of them: Adobe Flash Player Updater and GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore. I can’t even exonerate them, as I’m not a Bluetooth user myself. If I was trying to resolve
 this, I would remove all these tasks from System32\Tasks, and add them back in, repairing as I went, until the problem occurred. One thing to watch out for: the task typically is not run when it is installed, but on a trigger, such as logon or a reboot, and
 so the problem might be removed considerably in time from the repair that reinstalled it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m sorry that I’m not able to be of more help, but I wish you all luck in trying to resolve this.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div style="color: rgb(53, 28, 117); font-family: tahoma,sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;
Thank you again for your response and input. I narrowed the problem down to one of these two tasks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Task McAfee Remediation (Prepare) reported 'ERROR: The task object version is either unsupported or invalid.'&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div style="color: rgb(53, 28, 117); font-family: tahoma,sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;
If I try to repair them, my bluetooth goes away. If I then remove the 2 repaired files from the System32/Tasks folder and replace them with the files from my backup folder, then run Scan in RepairTasks, no error is found, and upon reboot, my bluetooth is still
 missing. I have to resort to System Restore to get bluetooth back. Any thoughts on this?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: rgb(53, 28, 117); font-family: tahoma,sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;
I am tempted to move these 2 files to a temporary folder and use my computer for a while to see if I notice any adverse effect. Thanks again!!&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The fact that Scan completes without errors after replacing the task files with the backups tells you that the task files are then installed correctly and will be run at the configured times. You can be confident of this because Scan invokes a system utility
 to check each installed task, which, amongst other things, validates the task file against a hash held in the registry. It is the failure of this check that gives rise to the original ‘corrupt’ message. So you are right, I believe, in thinking that one of
 these two tasks is causing your problem. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The McAfee task was apparently added in a mid-2015 update as ‘part of the precautions being built into the software for those people who will soon upgrade to Windows 10 to ensure the software will work OK afterwards’ (from
&lt;a href="https://community.mcafee.com/thread/81802?tstart=0" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://community.mcafee.com/thread/81802?tstart=0&lt;/a&gt; )
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
An Internet search for “WC3 task” reveals that it starts up Asus Wireless Console 3, I think at boot, to ‘manage the wifi and bluetooth connections’ (from
&lt;a href="http://rog.asus.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-27739.html?s=a087671915dfa5ea072b39a2def6d790" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://rog.asus.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-27739.html?s=a087671915dfa5ea072b39a2def6d790&lt;/a&gt; ). This is obviously a much more likely candidate. I think I would uninstall and reinstall Asus Wireless Console 3, or leave it uninstalled, on the grounds that
 it does not appear to be doing the right thing at the moment. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think I would also be comfortable with removing the McAfee task if it is causing trouble, but it sounds pretty harmless, if of no use to you.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As a side note, it is always possible to have a look in the task files to see what they do. They are just XML files that you can read in notepad et cetera. The Actions tag, usually found near the bottom of the file, tells you what it does. The Triggers tag,
 usually just above this, tells you when it does it. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It sounds like your diligent pursuit of the problem is bringing you close to a successful resolution.

So I followed the instruction on downloading Windows 7 tasks. After, I brought the elements to my desk and opened the zip file. It worked perfectly.
 Thanks very much to people who spent time to help us. We are numerous to have tried windows 10 and prefered come back to 7.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I have one thing for you to add. Several cleanup utilities (even ccleaner at one time) remove the windows\system32\logfiles\scm folder. This results in selected task "{0}" no longer exists errors within Task Scheduler. The fix is to recreate
 the missing folder and reboot. If you could add a check for this, that would be wonderful.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I think that this is an excellent idea. Why the presence of this folder should be so important to the Task Scheduler is less than obvious, but it certainly seems to be so.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I got a somewhat different outcome when I removed the Scm folder on a clean Windows 7 machine: I got a “program cannot find specified folder” pop-up for every configured task, and the problem was fixable without a reboot, but ugly or what?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m converting this thread to an issue, and will try to get to the implementation soon.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thank you for providing this tool. I downgraded because it turns out I have a Lenovo model that does not support upgrade to Windows 10 (Ideapad Y480) and didn't learn that until after I tried to upgrade.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I ran Task Repair once and it cleaned up a number of issues, but that didn't solve the backup problem, so I ran it again. Now it identifies 9 corrupt task images, then aborts with the message:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Scan terminated by unexpected error 'Access to the path 'ActivateWindowsSearch.&lt;em&gt;hidden&lt;/em&gt;' is denied
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If I go ahead and click the Repair button anyway, each of the 9 attempts to repair fails and results in a message of the form
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Cannot copy task file 'C:\Windows\system32\Tasks\Adobe Flash Player Updater', Access to the path 'C:\Users\Richard\AppData\Local\Temp\Adobe Flash Player Updater' is denied
&lt;br&gt;

I'm running Repair Task from the downloads directory as administrator. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi workman&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let me first explain a little about what is going on. When you run Repair, the task file has to be removed from System32\Tasks and reinstalled from another location. RepairTasks achieves this by copying the task file to the user’s temp folder, in your case
 ‘C:\Users\Richard\AppData\Local\Temp’, and renaming the existing task file X to X.hidden. If the repair fails, the task file is copied back to System32\Tasks. However, I have found that some antivirus products prevent or reverse this restore operation, so
 later Scan operations, on finding that a task file X.hidden is present but the corresponding task file X is not, rename X.hidden to X so that it does not just disappear from sight.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The obvious puzzle in your case is why did any repairs work? After all, they were performing exactly the same operations that are now failing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I can’t immediately imagine an answer, but here are some things that you might try:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in Windows Explorer, navigate to Windows\System32\Tasks. If you get a message of the form “you do not have access to this folder, you want to grant it?”, say yes, then try things again.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;temporarily turn off antivirus protection and run RepairTasks again &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reboot the machine and try again. Sometimes a system can get into some strange states that only a reboot will cure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Do let me know what you find&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thanks for the reply, Dijji. So prompt! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Just after I posted this, I was reading the other threads and I found a recommendation to run Repair Tasks from the Documents directory. Sure enough, when I moved the app there, it ran like a charm and fixed all the corrupt images. I'm now relievedly finally
 doing a backup, after which I'll do a clean install and hopefully get the last Win10 detritus off the computer. I might add that problems with the Task Scheduler aren't the only ones I've had since the downgrade; I frequently can't install a new application,
 but get no error message. I'm now a Win10-phobe!&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Glad to hear that at least all your tasks are now back in shape. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I know that Windows marks files downloaded from the Internet as such; it looks like it runs them at a lower privilege level, too, whereas unzipping the executable to Documents will create a file without such a marking, and therefore with access to your full
 administrative privileges.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have added a note to the documentation.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji, &lt;br&gt;
Thanks for resolving many of the problems I had after reverting to Win 7 Pro from 10.
&lt;br&gt;
Yes, I should have waited longer to go to 10 and there are things to like but everyday was a new 'malfunction'. (10 Upgrade 2 wks ago, reversion to 7 Pro 64 4 days ago) but I thought I had everything backed up to redundant perfection. Acronis just will not
 revert back to original Win 7 64, so I used the control panel option and was left with a hobbled mess. I had at least 40 corrupted tasks and I AM Thankful that Repair Tasks DID fix the majority...many things much better but still have operational issues with
 what is otherwise a very high performance machine. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Would love some input from you or anyone with resulting 5 problems listed below that Repair Tasks just won't fix in admin mode.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\PerfTrack\BackgroundConfigSurveyor &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\RAC\RacTask &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\Shell\WindowsParentalControls &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict1 &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict2 &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi ChaacMesh &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m betting that Repair is producing things like: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'ERROR: The task XML contains a value which is incorrectly formatted or out of range.(2,8):version:1.5’
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If so, the steps to repair the remaining tasks are described towards the bottom of the Documentation page (see step 4 and later), and I really need to find a way of making this information more findable.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji, &lt;br&gt;
OK...I did finally see the zip with your supplied tasks...worked like a charm to fix those 5 above. Apparently I had more serious issues and while your fix did improve my situation, it could not restore my custom machine to it's previous state of near-perfection.
 Windows 10 is seemingly a plot. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Wanted to make sure you got my Most Sincere Thanks since when I did successfully revert to 7 64 pro from Acronis Disk Image from 8/7 last night I lost a few sent emails and not sure if they were sent, __
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The other folks with the same problem need to know that your Supplied Tasks which work like a charm need to be in Documents or they cannot be 'chosen' if on desktop or other locale such as downloads.__so...here's that email....
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hi Dijji, &lt;br&gt;
Sending this again just in case…reverted back to Disc Image from August 8 with Acronis…Success.
&lt;br&gt;
Had to reinstall a few updated programs that I installed after image backup, but no problems now…
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Just wanted to thank you again &amp;amp; say you’ve got a great ‘touch’ with programming.
&lt;br&gt;
My friend and local ‘computer guru’ here who is an onsite repair guy for a local firm came over last night and was Very Impressed with your Task Repair…needless to say he absconded with it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks again for a very elegant solution to a real head-scratching problem! &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Dijji, Just FYI Data Miner updates:&lt;br&gt;
Here's some great info on Win 7 updates by Fox Van Allen (techlicious) that are 'data miners'...got rid of them last night but it will take 'constant vigilance' to keep them from popping back up...Van Allen writes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
"Specifically, Microsoft has pushed four data-hungry updates: KB3068708, KB3022345 (which was replaced by the aforementioned KB3068708), KB3075249 and KB3080149. These updates say they are “for customer experience and diagnostic telemetry, and if installed,
 will regularly transmit data back to Microsoft. For some, this is a privacy concern; for others with metered Internet connections, Microsoft’s hunger for data could increase your monthly bill.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you’re intentionally holding on to the Windows 7 or Windows 8 operating system despite Windows 10 being a free upgrade, you may want to avoid installing these four updates on your PC. If you’ve already installed them (the most likely scenario – Windows updates
 itself automatically unless you tell it not to), you might want to uninstall them. This is relatively easy to do: Enter the Control Panel &amp;gt; Programs &amp;gt; Programs and Features &amp;gt; Installed Updates. Right click an update listed in the paragraph above,
 and then choose “Uninstall.” Then repeat the process until all four updates have been removed from your machine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now, it’s important to note that even if you uninstall these updates, Windows will likely attempt to reinstall them during a later Windows Update unless you take action to block them too. To do so, press the Windows key on your computer keyboard and type “Windows
 Update.” Choose the Windows Update option that then pops up. Locate one of the four updates, right click it and select “Hide update.” Again, repeat the process for each.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If your computer is running Windows 10, there are a handful of privacy and sharing settings we recommend you change. Check out our guide to Windows 10 privacy settings that lists the operating system’s most egregious features, and spells out what you need to
 do to disable each. It’s a must-read for anyone with a PC".&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Here is a &lt;a href="http://www.techlicious.com/blog/windows-7-windows-8-diagnostic-telemetry-update-kb3068708/" rel="nofollow"&gt;
link to the article&lt;/a&gt; mentioned by ChaacMesh. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here is the description provided by Microsoft for each of the updates that the article mentions:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
KB3080149 This package updates the Diagnostics and Telemetry tracking service to existing devices. This service provides benefits from the latest version of Windows to systems that have not yet upgraded. The update also supports applications that are subscribed
 to Visual Studio Application Insights. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
KB3068708 [was KB3022345] This update introduces the Diagnostics and Telemetry tracking service to existing devices. By applying this service, you can add benefits from the latest version of Windows to systems that have not yet upgraded. The update also supports
 applications that are subscribed to Visual Studio Application Insights. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
KB3075249 This update adds telemetry points to the User Account Control (UAC) feature to collect information on elevations that come from low integrity levels.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Of the four, it looks like KB3080149 and KB3068708 are the ones to look seriously at. I do wonder: what telemetry was already being sent that this extends; how I can discover what is going on, so I can decide whether I care; and what settings, if any, affect
 what is or isn’t sent. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thank you so much for creating this tool! It corrected most of my corruptions except for one, but I still have to put up with having to click "Okay" on a bunch of error messages in the Task Scheduler (too many to reiterated here) every time I
 open it. Probably due to leftovers from Windows 10? How do we get rid of those? I tried everything I found that you recommended to do, including using the Windows7Tasks.zip file method that you recommended, as well as searching for the fix from the backup
 copy of the tasks, and a copy of all of the tasks from another Windows 7 system and drive, but none of them corrected the errors. I also "unplugged" the one error found upon re-scan; and, when I open the Task Scheduler, I still have to click "Okay"
 on about a half dozen error messages (again, too many to quote here). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Can you please make this tool, or create another, that resolves all of those as well? Thanks again.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Steppen_Wolf &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I will certainly try and help if I can. What errors are you seeing when you open Task Scheduler? I don’t need a complete list, but a sample would be very helpful. It sounds as though RepairTasks is now reporting no errors on a Scan, is that right?
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;No, there is still one error, the "User_Feed_Synchronization..." one (although, as I said I "unplugged" that one, so hopefully it is not connected with the still-present errors). The other errors include... --Interruption-- Well, lo
 and behold, upon rebooting my computer and starting up the Task Scheduler after the reboot, all of the errors are gone now! I don't recall reading in any of your instructions that a reboot is required to fully realize the repairs (if I'm mistaken, I'm sorry).
 Also, forgive me, I don't mean to sound sarcastic, but don't you think it would be a very good idea to add that into the various places delineating and re-delineating your instructions?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now what I'm wondering is, what about all of the "tasks" that are in sub-directories in the C:\Windows\System32\Tasks directory? For instance, the Apple ones to run the auto-notifier about Apple software updates. None of those "sub-directory"
 'tasks' show up in the Task Scheduler; so, were they repaired and are they still running in the background though they don't show up in the Task Scheduler? Or were they NOT repaired, and were ignored by your tool? The latter certainly appears to be the case,
 but I hope I'm wrong. But if I'm right, is and/or are there some way(s) to recover them as well and/or make them show up in the Task Scheduler?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have a bunch of such sub-directories in the Tasks directory, but NONE of their tasks show up in the Task Scheduler. Is that commonplace but they're still working? If so, I wasn't aware of that. Or, in the reversion to Win's 7 from Win's 10, were the .xml
 files in those sub-directories inadvertently deleted and thus not picked up by your repair tool? I tried looking for .xml files in any of those sub-directories, and the Tasks root directory, and I couldn't find ANY with the standard Windows File Manager, yet
 with the Folder Options setting(s) set to be able to see hidden files. Do .xml files not show up regardless, or is that something else screwed up by the reversion?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am further wondering in general, not from you, if there are any other "mess-ups" of Windows caused by the reversion that most of us, as yet at least, don't know anything about. I have been getting a lot of BSOD crashes since the reversion a week
 or two ago, but Windows 7 was always an unstable OS, as was Windows 8.x and 10 even worse (I can't stand either of the latter), so I can't be sure if it's caused by the reversion or not, or by some other cause(s). I'll bet, even though Win's 10 and the reversion
 were supposed to preserve the Registry and fully restore it, that the Registry has been (severely?) messed up by the reversion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, politely, what gives; or, what's going on with those other, "subdirectory", "tasks"? Thank you for your quite-timely response and for all of your attempts, and realizations of actually doing so, to help with this and/or these
 matters. You're a prince among men (or princess among women?). Cheers, my friend!&lt;br&gt;

P.S.---I just ran your repair tool again just out of curiosity to see if that User_Feed_Synchronization error is still showing up, though unplugged, and it is; because I thought perhaps the reboot of my PC had corrected that one as well since the running of
 your repair tool (no such luck).&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Steppen_Wolf &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I don’t recommend a reboot in the documentation because I’ve never encountered a situation in which one is required. The only time that a reboot has proved relevant before was when one correspondent had a machine where the Task Scheduler Service was not running,
 but that generated a long list of errors, including causing RepairTasks to report every task as being in an invalid state.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the question of the task files, what I would expect to see is that the Task Library in the left-hand pane of the Task Scheduler mirrors the folder structure in System32\Tasks, with each task file appearing as a task in the corresponding folder. What
 RepairTasks does when you Scan, is to walk the folders underneath System32\Tasks, checking that each task file that it encounters is installed as a task. If you are getting only one error, then the implication is that the tasks are indeed installed, and therefore
 I would expect them to appear in the Task Scheduler. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Finally, on the one remaining error, unplugging a task leaves its file under System32\Tasks, but removes it from the knowledge of the system. Therefore, an error will be produced every time you run Scan. RepairTasks will attempt to reinstall the task if you
 press Repair: I would be interested to know what error you are getting when you do this, especially if you’re using the zip file.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I hope this helps &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Well, my antivirus program just crashed Firefox as I was well into a response to you, and I don't have the heart to start the message all over again. What in God's name could cause Firefox to be shutdown in such a way is beyond me! It is absurd! It just
 suddenly, very quickly, with no warning, and no notice of a virus associated with Firefox, closed down completely, such that I had to restart it. Suffice it to say that, no, your reply did NOT help. You haven't answered ANY of my questions. I am highly physically
 disabled and do not have any energy to waste, nor can I afford to waste any, so please don't waste any of my very limited energy writing thorough, very carefully written, comments, and not responding to them thoroughly. I'm not writing those messages for my
 health you know.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The tasks from the sub-directories do NOT show up in the Task Scheduler, and you don't address that. Please read my longer post above very closely. And I already told you what that one error was/is.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In addition, as I said, I tend to think that the reversion somehow deleted the .xml files in the sub-directories, so your tool couldn't pick up on them and re-create those tasks. Are you alluding that you've never run into that, had that reported to you before,
 and/or haven't picked up on that yourself; or are you aware of it but are remaining quiet about it; because, obviously if those .xml files are no longer there, your tool can't "un-corrupt" them, unless of course it can "re- pull and create"
 them from the Registry or a backup copy from somewhere else in the system?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Further, contrary to your claim(s) that the latest version of your tool's file is a .zip file that can be read unopened, I tried to run your .zip files unopened and I got an error message (I don't remember now what it was) that it would not work that way because
 the file wasn't recognized as appropriate for the "Repair". So I unpacked your .zip files and used the unpacked folders to run "Repair" by your tool, which then ran successfully (but without restoring the tasks in the sub-directories. Thus,
 either your tool isn't finding the .xml files in the sub-directories because they are no longer there, or your tool isn't truly scanning "underneath" into those sub-directories and recovering those tasks as you believe it is.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Please give a thorough response to ALL of my posts, including both this one and the longer preceding one. Thank you much.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I stand corrected (by myself), the Apple, Microsoft and other tasks show up on the Task Scheduler front page, "Task Scheduler (Local)" as active tasks; but they don't show up on the second page, the "Task Scheduler Library", and that's
 what threw me for a loop. I've never paid any attention to the first page of the Task Scheduler; because, as far as I know, the Task Scheduler Library page is the only page where you can edit the operation of the tasks, so it's the only page that I paid attention
 to; until now; because I have had occasions where I needed to edit and change some of the commands for the tasks, such as how often to run.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;You’re right, RepairTasks will not fix the User_Feed_Synchronization task. The Windows 7 tasks zip file does not include this task, as I took it from a fresh Windows 7 system, and the User_Feed_Synchronization task is not set up by default.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The task periodically synchronises RSS feeds with Internet Explorer. If you want this to work again, the best way forward would be to delete the task file (it is already unplugged from the Task Scheduler) and reconfigure IE, either from the command line, using:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;msfeedssync enable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
or I think from the Control Panel, at Control Panel &amp;gt; Internet Options &amp;gt; Content(tab) &amp;gt; Feeds and Web Slices &amp;gt; Settings(button)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Otherwise, you now seem to be in good shape. I have never come across reversion to Windows 7 removing task files. The only time I’ve seen task XML files disappear was with earlier versions of RepairTasks. The Repair operation involves temporary removal of the
 task file from System32\Tasks, and I had some problems where interference from antivirus programs prevented me from putting it back in cases where the repair failed. I fixed this in the end by renaming the files instead of moving them to the temp directory
 (see the source code for the full gory details). &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Yes, thank you, I do appear to be in good shape now. [Except, in fooling around with Andy's damn(ed) android emulator for the Windows desktop, I've been going through nothing but headaches, crashes and a waste of my time and energy! :o) Their product is
 replete with problems, but their "support", as is typical of "tech 'support'" today, is abysmal. Yesterday, as I was "swiping" with the mouse in the settings, I accidentally did something that turned the "home page"
 into a "dialer" page, and I couldn't get out of it and back to the actual home page with all of my many apps that I had installed. I wrote a message on Andy's so-called "support" page on Facebook; but, of course, they never responded with
 any help as usual. So, I had to reinstall the product; and, in the process, I of course lost all of the hours of work in installing, and all of those actual, apps. And, because Google is working with the NSA and the CIA (what I call, "al CIAduh{!}")
 in spying on all of us with huge computer systems, I didn't want them sharing my private information with the "gub'ment", so I had stupidly shut off all of my apps and settings being saved to their cloud, and allegedly deleted all of the info in
 the process (a deletion that they probably don't really do, but retain all of the info for "al CIAduh{!}" and the NSA), just before the problem (dummy me). I should have left the damn setting on until after I reinstalled Andy and restored all of
 the apps and settings; and, also of course, I didn't know when I shut that setting off that I was going to have that major problem and screw-up of Andy (but, of course, who knows, perhaps if I had left that setting on and restored from it, the restoration
 process would have put back that "setting" that caused the problem and the dialer page in the first place, and put me right back where I was stuck with that page and unable to get out it!). Thus, now, needless to say, I'm burned out screwing with
 Andy anymore, and I'm not going to "play" with it any longer and take the chance of re-installing all of those apps and something else going wrong and losing me all of my hard work.]&lt;br&gt;

I executed step with the inplace repair afterwards I got the know five problems: &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\PerfTrack\BackgroundConfigSurveyor &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\RAC\RacTask &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\Shell\WindowsParentalControls &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict1 &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict2 &lt;br&gt;
Scan completed: 5 problems found &lt;br&gt;
Therefore I used your taskfile for repair and afterwards. Scan was running successfully. So I did immediately a backup. So far so good. But after a reboot which took enormous time. I checked first the systembackup and found the default are gone again. Then
 I started your taskscan onemore I received 136 errors with unknown network adress and wrong TCP-IP address. I did the whole process two times and it ended up always with the same result. Any idea what changed the values again? Thanks in advance.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It's worked brilliantly to repair two systems which had been reverted from Windows 10. Thank you for saving my time and temper!
&lt;br&gt;
But today I'm trying to fix a Win 7 HP system which I don't think has been upgraded to 10 and back, but Task Scheduler displays similar symptoms. Repair Tasks loads, scans, finds dozens of tasks (Windows and other stuff) as "Task not installed". Click
 on Repair - immediately get " Repair Tasks has stopped working". If I run it again I see that the first task has been repaired, but the rest remain 'not installed'.
&lt;br&gt;
Somewhat flaky system, so probably not your program's fault: SFC fails, including from a Win7 USB.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It seems that I have an unhandled exception i.e. something is failing that I did not think would ever fail. Maybe it is a reflection of the unusual state of this machine.

If I create a version with extra diagnostics in, would you be prepared to run it for me? It is exactly looking at the failures that helps improve the quality of my program.

&lt;div&gt;I'd be glad to have a try, but, be warned, I'm not a coder. (I used to be, but that was an unbelievably long time ago.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The system in question has just run SFC /scannow in Safe Mode - found errors but failed to repair, as it did in normal mode, and when run from a Win 7 USB. I'm about to try DISM, more in hope than expectation. History: this is a client computer in for
 a long overdue routine service. The client didn't report any particular problems, but that doesn't say much! It's due to go back on Friday, so we don't have a great deal of time to experiment - if it isn't behaving by tomorrow midday (GMT +1) I shall have

&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;Hello Dijji,
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Further to yesterday's efforts: my brain was failing, not DISM, it's Windows 7, I meant System Update Readiness Tool - it didn't do anything.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;On examining Task Scheduler, I find that the tasks which RepairTasks &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; to have repaired - they don't appear on the list after scanning any more - are
&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; present in Task Scheduler, and no message pops up to say that they are missing when Task Scheduler starts. In other words, it looks like RepairTasks is not really repairing them, but removing them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Regrettably, I'm going to have to abandon the attempt, and rebuild the system, I don't have time to indulge in the level of investigation I'd enjoy! I expect to use RepairTasks again, since we are getting a steady trickle of people needing help with broken
 Windows 10 upgrade/reversion attempts! I'll be sure to give you feedback.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Joyce. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think you're right, it was removing them. For the reinstallation of the task to work, the task file and registry entries have to be removed before the attempt is made. I think the unexpected error was blowing the tool up and preventing it restoring the task
 file, which is supposed to be what happens when the reinstallation fails. Currently, the registry entries remain deleted until reinstallation succeeds, which is why tasks for which reinstallation has failed don't show up in Task Scheduler.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have a new version on the test bench with a lot more error trapping and which also backs up and restores the registry entries, so that if reinstallation fails, or if some unexpected error occurs, everything should be restored to the state in which the tool
 found it. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I quite understand that you have had to move on and rebuild the machine. Even so, your input will make the next version significantly stronger, and I hope, save a bunch of other people time and trouble. Thank you.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;Hello Dijji,
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Looking forward to trying version 2.
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here's a little coding project for you:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Our clients are mostly simple souls. The first most of them heard about Windows 10 was when "these messages kept coming up". Now I'm finding that a great proportion of their systems are showing Windows Updates failed constantly, because every
 day it is failing the Windows 10 Upgrade. The thought of most of them attempting the upgrade is terrifying, so I'm going through the procedure to remove it completely. It's getting more than a little boring! I can perform the procedure via our remote access,
 but there has to be a restart in the middle, so we have to reconnect. I wonder if you could write some magic to do this:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; border: currentColor; border-image: none;"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Uninstall and hide KB3035583 and KB2952664 (Windows 7) or KB2976978 (Windows 8.1).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Remove all the registry keys under&lt;font color="#0ac000" href="https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/workitem/000000" workitemlink"=""&gt;#000000"&amp;gt; &lt;span style='line-height: 107%; font-family: "Segoe UI",sans-serif;'&gt;

I just came across this: &lt;a href="http://blog.ultimateoutsider.com/2015/08/using-gwx-stopper-to-permanently-remove.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://blog.ultimateoutsider.com/2015/08/using-gwx-stopper-to-permanently-remove.html&lt;/a&gt; , which seems to be exactly the sort of thing you’re looking for. I haven’t tried it myself, and Microsoft are apparently finding ways around it, but you may find it useful.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;You don't need to open the zip file. Once you have download the Windows7 Tasks.zip file, open RepairTtasks, check the ‘Take tasks from backup’ radio button, then click Repair. In the dialog that opens, select the Windows7 Tasks.zip file in its downloaded

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Good evening, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I just reverted from Windows 10 to Windows 7 (French version). &lt;br&gt;
I ran into an issue with Windows back-up and restore with error code 0x81000031. &lt;br&gt;
I opened Task scheduler, and had many messages "Task image corrupted or...", and happily solved them with your tool (Bravo!).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But, unfortunately, the Windows back-up and restore still run into error code 0x81000031.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Would you have an idea on how to solve that issue? Is it related to the fact that your tool doesn't handle non-US version of Windows?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kind Regards, &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Philippe&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
0x81000031 is usually caused by a problem with your Libraries.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you look at each library in Explorer, at the top of the right-hand pane it will say e.g. “Documents Library” and underneath “Includes: 2 locations". Click on the locations to see what the folders are. Usually, it turns out that some inaccessible drive
 is included. The last time I had this, it turned out that Pictures included the drive for a camera that had only temporarily been plugged in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I don’t think that you have any language related issues, though I must apologise for the horribly Anglo centric limitations of my own efforts.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First, let me thank you for your prompt answer. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let me add some more information to my initial message. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After several tests (adding one by one the libraries to back-up in the back-up selection), the culprits are identified: they are music and pictures libraries, that can't be saved in the back-up and generate the 0x81000031 error.
&lt;br&gt;
I will use your solution this evening, as I suspect that Windows 10 added my phone as one device storing pictures and music.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am convinced that Microsoft should embed your software in the procedure to revert from Windows 10 to Windows 7.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kind regards, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;Just a quick note to let you know that, thanks to your help, everything is back to normal. Backup is again fully operational.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;Microsoft should select you to help them to clean Windows 10!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;By the way, are you now back to W7 or have you gone back to W10?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;When do you think will be the right time to migrate?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;As of me, I experienced with W10 a loss of Ethernet connection, plus many slowdowns of the system. It looks as if Microsoft released W10 2 to 3 months too early, judging with the speed they release
 big updates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Philippe &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m glad to hear that all is now well with you. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am currently on my third visit to the land of Windows 10. The deal breaker each time has been a specific third-party software and hardware combination on which I depend, and which is an ongoing issue. But having jumped almost as soon as possible, and again
 repeatedly since, I have noticed that the general experience has been improving each time. On my first visit, Task Manager didn’t work properly!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There may be a hint as to what is going on in the current cumulative update. It updates 4800 files in total, 300 of them with versions created on or after 15 September. So, clearly, things are still in flux. Maybe RepairTasks will become redundant soon: I’m
 sure there’s a bug for it somewhere, it’s just a question of its priority. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But having said all that, I hope to stay with Windows 10 this time. I find that it feels crisper than Windows 7 did. It certainly runs using a lot less memory. I seem to have cast off a good deal of Windows 7 bloat, somehow. Equally, however, I might find something
 that breaks me tomorrow. I’m certainly not going to clean up Windows.old just yet.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The Repair Tasks fix is fantastic. It fixed over sixty corrupted tasks. Three errors persist. My saved log:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Task Microsoft\Windows\RAC\RacTask reported 'ERROR: The system cannot find the path specified.'
&lt;br&gt;
Task Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict1 reported 'ERROR: The system cannot find the path specified.'
&lt;br&gt;
Task Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict2 reported 'ERROR: The system cannot find the path specified.'
&lt;br&gt;
Scan completed: 3 problems found &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When I open my task scheduler I receive the following error pops up 3 times: &lt;br&gt;
The selected task "{0}" no longer exists. To see the current tasks, click Refresh.

&lt;br&gt;
These are fairly typical errors after reversion from Windows 10. To fix them, download Windows7 Tasks.zip from my site, if you have not done so already, then check the 'Take tasks from backup' radio button, click Repair, and select the downloaded zip file in
 the dialog that pops up. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I can’t say I’ve ever seen this one before. It’s saying that it cannot set up the tasks because it cannot set up their triggers, all of which are based on the Windows event log.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One diagnostic that I might suggest is to go into Task Scheduler and try to set up a new task with one of the same triggers. The steps are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in Task Scheduler create a new task in the Task Scheduler Library &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in the Triggers tab, create a new trigger. From the drop-down at the top, select begin on an event
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for the log, pick System; for the source, pick Tcpip; for the event ID, specify 4198, and press ok&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Does that work? You will see that this sets up the same trigger as that used by one of the TCP/IP address conflict tasks.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Having said all this, you might want to limit the amount of time spent on fixing this, since the two TCP/IP tasks are designed purely to help with situations where a TCP/IP address conflict has occurred, and the RACTask is a “Microsoft Reliability Analysis
 task to process system reliability data”, so none of them are life-threatening problems. Still, it’s annoying, isn’t it?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji, &lt;br&gt;
Please note that I'm just a Windows user and not a programmer..! I bumped into your tool via the answers.microsoft.com site, as my Windows 7 Backup and restore gave me error 0x80041321, after downgrading from W10.
&lt;br&gt;
Up to now your tool has been able to repair something like 24 errors, but I'm unable to get the last ones from the list resolved, even when using your Windows Task file download. I even copied a Task file from another windows 7 computer I own and still no result.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The errors I tried to resolve are those that Chaacresh also describes on Sept 10 :
&lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\PerfTrack\BackgroundConfigSurveyor &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\RAC\RacTask &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\Shell\WindowsParentalControls &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict1 &lt;br&gt;
Task image corrupt: Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict2 &lt;br&gt;
Scan completed: 5 problems found &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But when I run the tool in the 'repair /take tasks from backup' mode (the Task file has been copied into the Documents folder - the tool does not allow me to access a temp folder (?)), I get an error that the Repair Task tool is unable to find these files:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Cannot find either 'C:\Users\Phias\Documents\Windows7 Tasks\BackgroundConfigSurveyor' or 'C:\Users\Phias\Documents\Windows7 Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\PerfTrack\BackgroundConfigSurveyor'
&lt;br&gt;
Cannot find either 'C:\Users\Phias\Documents\Windows7 Tasks\RacTask' or 'C:\Users\Phias\Documents\Windows7 Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\RAC\RacTask'
&lt;br&gt;
Cannot find either 'C:\Users\Phias\Documents\Windows7 Tasks\WindowsParentalControls' or 'C:\Users\Phias\Documents\Windows7 Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\WindowsParentalControls'
&lt;br&gt;
Cannot find either 'C:\Users\Phias\Documents\Windows7 Tasks\IpAddressConflict1' or 'C:\Users\Phias\Documents\Windows7 Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict1'
&lt;br&gt;
Cannot find either 'C:\Users\Phias\Documents\Windows7 Tasks\IpAddressConflict2' or 'C:\Users\Phias\Documents\Windows7 Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict2'
&lt;br&gt;
Repair completed: 0 tasks repaired; 5 repairs failed &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Although when I look via Windows Explorer, those file are there...That's where I'm lost, and where Backup and restore still does not want to work, giving me the error 0x81000031 which seems to have to do with library location, syntax etc.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm unsure if one thing (the tool unable to find files and repair them) has to do with the Backup and restore error on the other end.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It would be great if you could shed a light on this, and if your tool can fix the above. I repeat, just for clearness sake that I am not a programmer, just a plain standard Windows user....
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks already for your help!&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thank you very much for your help. It is only with this sort of feedback that I can hope to get rid of the nasty gotchas that we programmers tend to leave in, despite our best efforts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In this case, the problem seems to be about getting the Windows 7 tasks into a place where RepairTasks, which I’m now thinking is being ridiculously intolerant, can get at them. Here is a detailed set of steps that should work with the current version. Could
 you give them a try and let me know what happens? In the meanwhile, I'll have a look at that backup and restore error to see if there is any help I can give.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Windows Explorer, navigate to a copy of Windows7 Tasks.zip &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expand the folder, you should be able to see a folder within it called Tasks &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right click on Tasks, and say copy &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Windows Explorer, navigate to your Documents folder &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right click on some empty space, and say paste &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should now have a folder in documents called Tasks, which contains an unzipped copy of all the Windows 7 task definitions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run RepairTasks, specifying use backup folder. When asked for the folder, point at the Tasks folder that you have created in Documents&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Dijji&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
PS version 3 of RepairTasks allows Windows 7Tasks.zip to be used without actually unzipping it. The procedure given above is now only required for version 2 and before.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Dijji Good evening,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
sorry for the delay in coming back to you, but I've been a couple of days on the road without my laptop... :)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, I wanted to say 'thank you' because all errors are gone now. I removed all the previous 'task' files from the My documents folder and followed precisely the steps as laid out by you. Maybe I need to add that when I ran 'TaskRepair', I immediately choose
 the 'take tasks from backup' option, ran the scan which listed the 5 famous errors (see initial discussion thread), and afterwards ran the 'repair' option with 'take tasks from backup' highlighted.&lt;br&gt;
So now all errors are solved.&lt;br&gt;
Thanks also for the thread on the Backup and Recovery, which still seems to give me some headaches. I'll run through that thread, and will keep you posted if I'm able to resolve.&lt;br&gt;
My goal is - unlike a lot of people I read 'downgrading' back from W10 to W7 to stay there - to get back to W10, which worked reasonably well for me and which I did not dislike. I did one stupid thing, which was creating my user account linking it to my hotmail
 account, which then starts sending bunches of info to MS. Which I don't like, and which caused issues in one of my linked GMail accounts. But it seems you can create a 'local account' w/o mention or use of an email, and w/o sending all that info to Bill and
 company. But you can't create such with equal rights if you already have created an account with your email in W10. that's why I got back to W7, and will - if I get my backup to work again - go back to W10 creating a local account with administrator rights
 as in W7. Sorry, I'm drifting off, but guessed that maybe it would be of interest to you and other readers.&lt;br&gt;
Thanks again Dijji for all your help!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Update 21 Sept : Dijji - I was also able to fix the Backup and Recovery issue, taking the information of the thread you sent me earlier. I had to tweak and adjust the Backup settings a bit, but it works now! I'm still unsure if and up to what extent the 'tasks'
 problem I had was/is also linked to the error 0x81000031 Windows B&amp;amp;R produced... Maybe worth investigating!&lt;br&gt;
Thanks &amp;amp; best regards! Peter&lt;br&gt;

I am glad that everything seems, finally, to be sorted out. I also want to thank you for your input, showing me rough spots that needed to be filed down. As a direct result of your feedback, I have a new version in the works which will allow installation from
 the zip file without unzipping it, and is also more flexible about finding task files. So thank you on behalf of the future users who find their lives made easier!

It seems that these are an operating system upgrade issue of another kind. This &lt;a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/task-scheduler-has-corrupted-tasks-how-do-i-fix-it/aaa3552f-f602-4b58-a746-f6ec94ed47d1?auth=1" rel="nofollow"&gt;
thread&lt;/a&gt; indicates that they are obsolete Windows Vista tasks left over from a previous upgrade.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This &lt;a href="http://blog.tiensivu.com/aaron/archives/1193-Detailed-descriptions-of-the-default-scheduled-tasks-on-a-standard-Windows-Vista-installation.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;
site&lt;/a&gt; gives descriptions of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As none of them still seem to be relevant, the best bet looks to be just to remove them. See if Task Scheduler will let you. If not, the just released version 3 of RepairTasks will help you clean them off the system.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi PtR&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m wondering whether this is to do with task definitions themselves. If you open up a task file in Notepad or similar, you will find that it is just XML with the file extension sawn off. Look for the &amp;lt;Principals&amp;gt; section, which defines the identity under
 which the task is to be run. Here is an example from an Adobe installed task:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;Principals&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Principal id="Author"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;UserId&amp;gt;System&amp;lt;/UserId&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;LogonType&amp;gt;InteractiveTokenOrPassword&amp;lt;/LogonType&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;RunLevel&amp;gt;LeastPrivilege&amp;lt;/RunLevel&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Principal&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/Principals&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
As you can see, this basically says run as system. I’m wondering if the journey via Windows 10 mutated the principal specified for your tasks to something that your system does not recognise, hence the error you are getting. If so, one way of correcting it
 would be to create some new task in the way you did before, and copy the Principals section over to the damaged definitions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Diji &lt;br&gt;
you were correct, I noticed that newer tasks that I created had &lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;LogonType&amp;gt;InteractiveToken&amp;lt;/LogonType&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
whereas the ones that were failing had&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;LogonType&amp;gt;Password&amp;lt;/LogonType&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
I just edited those few tasks to have LogonType as InteractiveToken and they repaired OK.
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks again for the program and the response. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi redlorakeeet&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Windows Backup Monitor runs every time you logon more unlock the computer to check whether a backup data has been missed. It is created when you configure a backup, so it may be possible to fix this just by tweaking your backup settings, causing the configuration
 to be updated. If that doesn’t work, I have added a copy of a valid version to Windows7 Tasks.zip and updated the version 2.2 download. You can download this updated copy and use it to repair the task.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have not been able to find Customer Experience Improvement Program\Uploader on any of my Windows 7 or Windows 10 systems, so I’m not entirely sure what it is. The name indicates pretty strongly that it is about uploading data collected about your use of Windows
 to Microsoft, so its failure to run is unlikely to do you any harm. If you can find a working version anywhere, RepairTasks will be able to apply it. However, it may be a Windows 10 only thing, so no Windows 7 version may exist. In this case, removing it would
 be appropriate. Unfortunately, Task Scheduler won’t let you, and RepairTasks does not include a delete command (maybe it should!). You can get close: if you run the RepairTasks beta, Repair will remove the registry entries, then deleting the task file from\System
 32\Tasks will completely remove it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I hope this helps&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dijji&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
PS the newly released version 3 of RepairTasks supports unplugging a task from Task Scheduler by removing the registry entries, so that the trick described above using the beta is no longer required.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Fingers crossed I think we're there now. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I followed your instructions and your new tasks file did the trick for the backup problem.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The customer experience one was still there so I ran your beta version and then found the file in the system 32 folder and deleted it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I ran the task repair file again and it says there are no errors so I'm very very very happy.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks so much for your help with this. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I now have the updates to sort out which keep failing on me. :(&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;First, thank you for writing this program, as I have been stuck for days trying to figure out how to fix all the corrupt entries without deleting and recreating or reinstalling, since of course I didn't notice that I hadn't had any backups until almost
 two weeks after I had rolled back to Windows 7. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I noted some of the xml errors listed in the results, but did not run the program again with the windows 7 tasks, as scheduler opened with no error messages and I was able to create new tasks, so should I have run it again anyway using the windows 7 tasks zipfile?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also, because I run a lot of programs in compatibility mode, once Task Repair finished repairing, Windows automatically tried to run setup for about nine programs at once! luckily it couldn't find the setup files for most of them. Just letting you know in case
 anyone freaks out about that. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks so much again for writing this program, I would have been lost without it.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thank you for your feedback, and the warning about compatibility storms! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Things on your system are slightly less healthy than they look. When RepairTasks tries but fails to recover a task, it’s registry entries remain deleted, which causes the task to disappear from the view of Task Scheduler. The task at this stage is not fixed,
 but merely unplugged. Do we care? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The tasks left with XML errors after rollback to Windows 7 typically include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft\Windows\PerfTrack\BackgroundConfigSurveyor Run at 3am if idle - Performance Tracing Idle Task: Background configuration surveyor
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft\Windows\RAC\RacTask. Run on event or 1am - Microsoft Reliability Analysis task to process system reliability data.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft\Windows\Shell\WindowsParentalControls. Run at logon - Notifications for actions taken by Windows Parental Controls.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict1. Run at event - This event is triggered when an IP address conflict is detected.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft\Windows\Tcpip\IpAddressConflict2. Ditto&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
A little unclear, but the least the IP address conflict resolution looks worth having. In general, I would recommend completing the repair using the Windows 7 tasks. An upcoming revision of the tool will reflect the situation more honestly by restoring the
 registry entries when it fails to recover a task, so that Task Scheduler will continue to pick up the problems.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi, thanks for the explanation, I ran repair tasks again using the windows 7 tasks and it's reporting no errors now, I didn't see your notice about the new version to download, but will grab it for safekeeping.

    <Discussion Title="Repairs fail with “The task XML contains a value which is incorrectly formatted or out of range”">

        <Post From="Dijji" When="24/08/2015 20:15:26">
          <Html>
        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;This occurs when Windows 10 leaves behind a task XML file with a revised format that Windows 7 cannot understand. The most common complaint refers to ‘(2,8):version:1.5', which means that line 2, column 8 of the XML has a value for the version of the file
 format, 1.5, which Windows 7 cannot read, as it expects files with format version 1.2.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To get out of this, it is necessary to provide a task XML file with format version 1.2. This can come from a backup, if you have one; or another Windows 7 system; or from the ‘Windows7 Tasks.zip’ download that I provide.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To tell my tool to use an external source of task XML files, select the ‘Take tasks from backup’ radio button before pressing Repair. The program will prompt for a folder containing the task XML files. A good approach is to first set up a temporary folder to
 hold these files. If you are taking the files from a backup or another Windows 7 system, copy the contents of the Windows\System32\Tasks directory to your temporary folder. If you are using my download, unzip its contents to your temporary folder. Then, when
 prompted, specify the Tasks folder within your temporary folder as the source of the tasks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note: it is best to use backup task XML files only to fix tasks for which ‘Recycle existing tasks’ has failed, so as to preserve as many of the task settings and configurations held in the original files as possible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
if you have any problems with this procedure, or any tasks remain unrepaired, please let me know.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello Dijji,&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately, I did not read the above post, nor did I see that you had provided a windows7 task.zip
&lt;br&gt;
What should my next move be in view of this? I do not have a recent backup of scheduler as when I rolled back to 7 from 10 the scheduled backups were not running. Additionally, I have this "task" trying to run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Start a program | C:\Windows\system32\pcalua.exe -a E:\Setup.exe -d E:\&lt;br&gt;
I do not have an E drive. D: is my cd/dvd player F: is my internal back up drive. So of course I continue to get an error message, windows cannot fine E&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you in advance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After running the program/repair the second time, this is what is left:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Recovery of task Microsoft\Windows\PerfTrack\BackgroundConfigSurveyor failed with 'ERROR: The task XML contains a value which is incorrectly formatted or out of range.(2,8):version:1.5'&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Miami3170&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Looking at those errors, you are on exactly the right track. My tool is supposed to be run iteratively, in fact, by design, you can run it as many times as you like without harm.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, you have successfully completed stage one, which is to repair all the tasks left by Windows 10 that are compatible with Windows 7. Now you need to proceed with stage two, using the ‘Take tasks from backup’ radio button as described above.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If all goes well, you should be left with just the pcalua problem. This looks like a task that was reconfigured by Windows 10 for drive letters that it allocated, differing from the letter allocations that you use in Windows 7. The trick is to find the task
 and reconfigure it. Unfortunately, I don't have such a thing running, so I have to speculate to some extent. Apparently, pcalua is a Microsoft program dealing with program compatibility issues, and this task is scheduled when it thinks it has found some. If
 you open Task Scheduler, and look at the running tasks, you may be able to discover the name of the task, and then you will be able to go into the Task Library part of the tree and reconfigure it. There is also some evidence on the web that it will be one
 of the tasks in the root folder of the Task Library with a GUID for a name, so you could just look at each of those to see if its Action is to run pcalua. Alternatively, if you have a program that will do text searches, then hunting through the directory tree
 under Windows\system32\Tasks for a file containing pcalua should identify the culprit, so that you can fix it in Task Scheduler.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hope this helps.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The first problem is bad documentation on my part. It looks like you have unzipped the Windows 7 tasks file to C:\Users\Lyriss\Desktop\Windows7 Tasks, and are pointing at that folder when you run the tool. What you need to do is to point at the Tasks folder
 within that folder instead, i.e. C:\Users\Lyriss\Desktop\Windows7 Tasks\Tasks. I have made the fix above.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am surprised, however, that the scan is picking up so many tasks to repair. I would have expected you to get complaints only about the tasks that had problems with invalid XML. What is scan telling you?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I haven't seen this before, but I will do what I can to help with it. To help me reproduce the problem, a sample task file would be very helpful. I'll send you a message, so we can make e-mail contact and pass attachments back and forth, if you're willing.,

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It turns out that this error occurs when the Task Scheduler service is not running. Another symptom is that when the Task Scheduler program is opened, the error "Remote computer not found" will be reported.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The only way out of this is to fix the problem with the Task Scheduler service. Once it is started, you should run RepairTasks and repair any problems with the 'Recycle existing tasks' option. Any remaining problems can then be dealt with as described above.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Just buyed used Thinkpad T420 from local dealer and it had windows 10 installed. Wanted windows 7 so dealer downgraded to Windows 7 pro 64bit. Everything else is working fine but when i open up task manager i get about 20 warnings about corrupted tasks
 "Task either corrupted or tampered with" . &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ran your program and it fixed problems so that there is no more warnings when opening up task manager. There are still following problems which are unrepairable:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Recovery of task Microsoft\Windows\PerfTrack\BackgroundConfigSurveyor failed with 'VIRHE: Teht„v„n XML sis„lt„„ arvon, jonka muoto on virheellinen tai joka ei ole sallitussa alueessa.(2,8):version:1.5'

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
English translation: "The task XML contains a value which is incorrectly formatted or out of range."
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, thank you :)&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi tpaasiala&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These residual errors are fixable: I've opened a new discussion thread with an appropriate title (to help people to find it), to describe the steps you need to take.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Have a look at the discussion ‘Repairs fail with “The task XML contains a value which is incorrectly formatted or out of range”‘&lt;br&gt;
