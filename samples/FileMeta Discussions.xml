&lt;br&gt;
i have installed filemeta today. (x86.msi) &lt;br&gt;
i have added a property handler to pdf. &lt;br&gt;
now a place was there for keywords, categories and so on... &lt;br&gt;
i added keywords, categories, ... in Windows Explorer &lt;br&gt;
I have pressed saved &lt;br&gt;
You will see a Windows 10 error message &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is usually a question of restarting all instances of Explorer, or at the very worst, rebooting your system. It happens because Explorer caches configuration that it has read from the registry.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If this does not fix your problem, let me know. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thanks for what looks like a great tool, exactly what I need. Unfortunately, it is not fully working for me - I am getting the same error message described here whenever I try to set/change a meta data value, on a Windows 7 system.

I have tried restating Windows Explorer, and a full reboot, with no change in the results. I also tried update Registry, however the Association tool says that no changes have been made which require a Registry update.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I've added a property handler to PDF using File Meta. &lt;br&gt;
I faced similar problems of Error Code 0x80004005 while trying to enter TAGS for a PDF file in Windows Explorer
&lt;br&gt;
I am running Windows 10 and the PDF files which I am trying to add TAGS are located on an external portable SAMSUNG T3 SSD DRIVE.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I read through this thread and I downloaded Property Test 1.0 for diagnostics purpose.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Below are the test results&lt;/h1&gt;
File: D:\test.pdf &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Property Handler: {D06391EE-2FEB-419B-9667-AD160D0849F3} &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Error: 0x80040154 instantiating Property Handler&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Extension .pdf has no configured property handler&lt;/h1&gt;
Hope you can advice on how to rectify this issue. I've thousands of readings in PDF which would benefit a lot if I can search the content with TAGS.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Many thanks &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;This error indicates that the property handler cannot be loaded because it or one of its dependencies cannot be found.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The first check is, are you running on a 64-bit system? If not, then you have installed the wrong version of File Meta.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Secondly, C:\Program Files\File Metadata should contain a file FileMetaPropertyHandler.dll, and if you look at the Details tab of the Properties dialog, you should see that the version is 1.5.6 128.0.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thirdly, the most important dependency is on msvcr100.dll, which you should find in C:\Windows\System32. Despite the name of the directory, this is a 64-bit file. Again, looking at the Details tab of the Properties dialog, you should see that the version is
 10.00.40219.325, and that the date modified is 11/06/2011. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let me know what you find in your system. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji, I'm having the same issues as soapplex. I have restarted both explorer and the machine, but the problem still persists. My machine is running a 64-bit system, and I'm getting the same test results message from the Property Tester as soapplex.
 The FileMetaPropertyHandler.dll file is as you described; however, the msvcr100.dll file does not match the version or date modified which you specified, it appears it was not updated as the version states 10.00.40219.1. Any thoughts?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The error reported by the property tester means “class not registered”, so a check of the registry is in order.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you run ‘regedit’, then navigate to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID{D06391EE-2FEB-419B-9667-AD160D0849F3}, this should contain a key called InprocServer32, with the default value C:\Program Files\File Metadata\FileMetaPropertyHandler.dll.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If this is missing, then the File Meta property handler is indeed not registered. Please let me know what you find.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If it is missing, one possible cause is failure to load msvcr100.dll. I’m not sure that the difference in the last digits is significant. However, you can download what is definitely the correct version at
&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=5555" rel="nofollow"&gt;
https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=5555&lt;/a&gt; If you install this, you can then try to fix the File Meta installation by uninstalling and then installing it. This should result in the registry key described above appearing.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Another possibility is building richer structures on top of the metadata. I’ve experimented myself with building virtual folders based on the tags attached to files i.e. if the tag USA is attached to a file, then a folder called USA appears containing
 that file. Multiple tags can be interpreted as folder hierarchies. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;No No, you misunderstood me and I am sorry for being vague.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Sorry about that, now I get it. If your Windows 10 x64 system is anything like mine, .lnk is in the list, it just appears in the top part because it already has a property handler (called ‘Shortcut’). At the moment, File Meta won’t allow you to install
 its handler where there already is one. Right now, you have to remove the existing handler first by tweaking the registry. In the case of .lnk this would probably be most unwise.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Adding support for extending existing property handlers is likely to be the main focus for the next release of File Meta in a few months time.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Yes, .lnk is present in the top part and as you have mentioned it doesn't allow me to add/install the handler. Will it be possible in future releases to make it possible to install property handler for the file type for which already a property handler

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It’s not impossible, but it is awkward. It certainly goes beyond the intentions of the design of the property system. For a long discussion of how it might be done, see

My main reservation about implementing it remains the possibility of leaving users confused rather than enabled.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Could you be more explicit about what you mean by ‘not working’? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When you add a handler where one already exists, it creates a custom profile by combining one of the standard profiles with the profile associated with the existing handler. You can look at the combined result in the custom profiles page in the Association
 manager. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What specific metadata are you adding? Where does it not show up? Does it appear in the Details tab in the properties dialog for a file of the type?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi, &lt;br&gt;
I startet hiding the metadata xml files to keep my folders clean (at least visual clean). The problem is that I always have to disable the hiding option before I can export the metada. When I try to export the metadata of a file which already has a hidden metadata
 xml file the following error appears: "0xd opening metadata file". What can I do about this?&lt;br&gt;

          <Html>
        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The error you are seeing translates as “Permission denied”. Marking a file as hidden is treated by the file system in the same way as marking it as system. According to the documentation, the usual file opening method will be able to read the file, but
 not write to it. The only workaround is to remove the hidden attribute: if I were to change the code to support this scenario, that is what exactly what my code would have to do, detect the hidden attribute, remove it, write the file, then replace the attribute.
 I’m not particularly keen to do this, as using the hidden attribute in this way is something of an abuse.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The only suggestion that I can make at the moment is to take advantage of the command line support for exporting XML files, which allows you to write them to a subfolder, where they are not obviously visible. There is a case for me adding this functionality
 to the context menu at some point in the future. &lt;br&gt;

 (2) search for xml files (3) disable the hiding option. :)&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;First, many thanks to dijji and whomever else is responsible for this great program, an organizational godsend. Unfortunately, a quirk has led me to uninstall it. File Metadata prevented me from being able to rotate images in File Explorer. I even tried
 a third party image rotator. When I uninstalled File Metadata I can rotate images again in Explorer. I know this is probably a nonissue for most, but any assistance would be appreciated.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          <Html>
        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I can confirm that this is indeed the case. If you apply the File Meta property handler to the .jpeg extension, rotate image in Explorer does not work. I imagine that this is because File Meta diverts property updates to the alternate stream storage, preventing
 Explorer changing the required properties on the .jpeg file itself. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Of course, to avoid this side-effect, it is not necessary to uninstall File Meta, you merely have to not apply the File Meta property handler to the .jpeg extension.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

          <Html>
        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;After a little further research, it appears that Explorer achieves rotation by modifying the EXIF properties of the image, causing it to be displayed differently, but leaving the underlying bits unchanged. This fails with File Meta, because the changes
 are written to the alternate stream, but the Windows viewer reads the properties directly from the .jpeg file, without using the property handler, and so accesses the original unchanged values.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There is no way to change the behaviour of File Meta to avoid this. However, third-party rotation tools that modify the bits rather than the properties will still work, even with File Meta configured for the extension. An example is JPEG Lossless Rotator.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I noticed if you use a tag with a / in it, if there's a similar tag before the slash, the similar tag won't be saved to the tags field of the file. Just for examples sake, if you have the tags coin; money; coin/money;, coin will be removed, but money will
 not as it's after the slash. Somewhat odd.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And for the exporting issue, from my observation, if there too much text in a given field, it won't export the metadata. It instead gives Error 0x8007007a invoking PSFormatForDisplay property with Id 5 in storage {F29F85E0-4FF9-1068-AB91-08002B27B3D9. Id in

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Interesting. The first of these sounds like a feature of the way explorer interprets the / character. I will check to see if this is the case.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The second point sounds like a bug in my code. It should handle arbitrary lengths of property value. I will investigate.
&lt;br&gt;

Thank you! &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Appreciate this software greatly. I've been searching for an in-house option that allows for handling of PDF metadata within explorer. This is working well! That said, is this software able to also handle metadata for file folders? I didn't see it listed
 in the file associations manager, but I may have missed it. I can't emphasize how helpful it would be to use metadata with the folders, as right now using the manual desktop.ini method is too time consuming for what I am doing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thanks, I'm glad you're finding the software useful. I did look at metadata for folders when I wrote this, because I would like to have it too, but could not find a way to make it work.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The way File Meta works for files is to write data into an alternate stream alongside the default stream which contains the main contents of the file. This doesn't work for folders because there is no stream, all the information about the folder is held in
 the Master File Table that controls the allocation of disk space. I don't know of any way to store metadata properties there. This is also why folders do not show up in the Association Manager: they have no equivalent to a file extension.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I didn't know about the alternative Desktop.ini approach, so thank you very much for pointing me to something new! For the uninitiated, you can add something like the following to the Desktop.ini file in a folder:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[{F29F85E0-4FF9-1068-AB91-08002B27B3D9}] &lt;br&gt;
Prop2=31,Title &lt;br&gt;
Prop3=31,Subject &lt;br&gt;
Prop4=31,Author &lt;br&gt;
Prop5=31,Keywords(Tags) &lt;br&gt;
Prop6=31,Comment &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then, if you add, say, a Subject column to the parent folder of the folder containing Desktop.ini, the folder will have "Subject" in that column. The GUID and the Prop numbers are just the same ones that show up in the XML obtained by exporting the
 metadata for a file. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately, the properties do not show up in the Details Pane, and there is no equivalent of the Details tab in the Properties dialog for the folder, so there is no way to edit any of the property values using the standard Explorer UI. The only option that
 I can think of is to add a custom dialog launched from the right click menu on the folder to edit the properties.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This does give us a way to make it happen, but would it be usable enough to be worth it? Or are there any other possible approaches?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I can only speak for myself, but I think it would be useful. It's a lot less time consuming than having to create a desktop.ini file for each and every folder, then open up the file and edit it one at a time. At least with some sort of GUI interface or
 a right-click option, you can quickly enter/edit the properties for each folder. It's not an ideal solution, but it's a better one than is given by Windows.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Nonetheless, I appreciate your explanation and ideas. Like I said, I'd been banging my head against the wall for a long time trying to incorporate PDFs into a library, but there was no way to do so within the context of explorer and that had rendered my library
 plans useless. Your software has given my library a new lease on life LOL &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you're able to figure out a way to incorporate folder properties, either in a separate GUI interface or something similar, count this as a vote in favor! Good luck and if you want to solicit any other opinions, I will gladly give my layman's two cents.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;There being at least one enthusiast, I've been thinking in more detail about how this could be done. It turns out that it would be almost completely technically disjoint from File Meta as it is now, so I think I would release it as a separate download.
 In fact, since it is about folders and not files at all, I think it is probably best as a separate project, say, Folder Meta.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm going to add it to my to-do list, but not at the top, because it doesn't have quite the same compelling ‘get a lot for a little’ characteristic that made me want to do File Meta. Of course, if other people chime in on this thread, then it will go up the
 list! In any case, if I do start on Folder Meta, I will post again on this thread to let everybody know.&lt;br&gt;

Looks like it's not freeware, though, so I'll have to decide if it's worth the cost of purchase. I might give the trial a shot and see how it goes.

Yes, I think folders tags can help anyone at managing folders better and quicker.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It is never too late to vote. Well, at least not until I come up with an implementation. I have given it some more thought: it turns out that NTFS allows metadata to be attached to folders in just the same way as files, so that’s perfect. The main remaining
 stumbling block is trying to find a way to present the metadata in Explorer and allow it to be edited.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There is no donations page because I'm not looking for cash from my work; it's kind of you to think of me, though, and I do encourage the support of developers that need it.

I have a comment of presenting metadata in Explorer. There is some software, for example this
&lt;a href="http://code.kliu.org/hashcheck/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://code.kliu.org/hashcheck/&lt;/a&gt;, which adds additional tabs to file or folder properties. This could be the way to deal with folder metadata.&lt;br&gt;

this seems to be similar in technology but a little different in functionality (no tags, but folder descriptions):

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Ingo &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yes, it is very similar! Thank you for pointing it out to me, I had no idea it existed. Reading the website, it looks like it is providing a property handler plus a context menu that allows you to open up an editor for the Contents property.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The only description of how to view the text, other than through the editor, is for files, when it talks about using the Details tab of Properties to see and edit the description for a file.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For a folder, it looks like the editor off the context menu is the only way. Would that work for you? It would be fairly trivial to add a similar editor to File Meta.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I have just discovered File Meta and I find it really wonderful! Finally I can control what to see in the preview panel! Thanks a lot.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Nevertheless I wanted to show my interest here for folder support. I use it for photography management and, although I use Lightroom for cataloging and tagging, I need to have an arranged and working structure on disc. I group photos by folders, and each folder
 has a job number assigned. The name of folder is the date of the job, and I add the job number to a 'Project' tag of folder. This is super useful and quick for sorting, searching, etc! The desktop.ini (current solution) is really slow and really bothering
 when an explorer restart (sometimes) is needed to update the changed fields...(losing opened folders, and tray icons in the way).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So I wanted to add my vote here as it would be extremely helpful to be able to do that (of course, if it could be like File Meta does for files it would be perfect, but the other solutions commented here would be also a big help).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Have you thought/worked more on a folder support/solution? Do you still consider it? Tx!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
First of all, I love your tool. It's very handy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I would like to sync the files of several pc's via cloud. The main problem is that every time I change the meta data a file the client of the cloud starts to reupload the whole file instead of just uploading the meta data. Therefor I want to ask if it would
 be possible to make windows work directly with the xml files when reading and editing the metadata of a pdf or anything else.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It would be possible to store the meta data in a separate XML file rather than the alternate stream attached to the file, but it would present a different set of problems.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For instance, where would the XML file be kept? In the same folder, cluttering things up, or, say in a meta data subfolder, or perhaps in a central folder? Then there are problems with synchronisation: how is the meta data to be moved with the file; what happens
 when the file is deleted, how is the meta data to be deleted; and what happens when the file is renamed, how is the connection to the XML file to be maintained?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As you can see, separating meta data from the file raises some difficult problems, to which I’ve never seen a good answer.

          <Html>
        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Greetings, &lt;br&gt;
this File Metadata utility closes a much needed gap on windows systems for me. I would love to use it, but I haven't found any way to get a look at the tags present on my system. There seem to be a ton of crappy tags ("System.Keyword") and I guess
 they found their way on my machine by just importing or copying some files onto it.
&lt;br&gt;
The result is that I have a multitude of tags that are completely irrelevant to me. If I now start to use tags myself for organizing my stuff they will drown in this sea of unwanted and pre-defined tags. It is challenging enough, IMHO, to maintain identity
 with tags alone in a closed system (I mean ensuring, that I do not one day give one and the same concept the tag "stuff", another day "Stuff", yet another day "stuffz" and on a bad day "crap").
&lt;br&gt;
But if my tags get flooded with alien tags it gets really challenging. &lt;br&gt;
To even have a chance to be able to be consistent, I would need at least the chance to take a look at all tags. So my considerations are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any windows native way or extra tool where I can get a glimpse of e.g. all "keywords", "categories", etc. that are meta data'ed to my files?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assuming those tags are slumbering somewhere in my registry and I get a way to take a look at them: Can I delete unneeded tags or will that damage / corrupt or somesuch the file that is suddenly with a metadate which is not registered?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
This tags issue alone is becoming enough of a bother for me to seriously contemplate foresaking windows and using MACOS or Linux for my private needs. Folders? Man, we are living in 2017. I expect a bit more of my primary information-technology device than
 mono-hierarchical folders and full-text search. Really. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sorry for the rant. Your utility is great. I wish and hope I can find a way to put it to productive use for me... - but it won't help me without some method to manage / organize / garden some of my metadata centrally.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I just need to clear up one terminological point before I answer your question. System.Comment, for example, is a property, not a tag. Tags are held in a particular property, called, somewhat confusingly, System.Keywords.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Windows defines a large set of properties, the idea being to support everything Windows knows about its files. Of course, that means that for most files, most properties are totally irrelevant.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The easiest way to see the properties that are defined for a particular file is to use Explorer. Right click on the file, choose properties, and select the Details tab, and all the properties associated with the file are shown. Note, however, that friendly
 property names are shown rather than the formal System.Comment et cetera (you can use the File Association Manager to see them if required).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The easiest way to see the properties that you’re interested in for a file is to choose the columns shown in the file list pane in Explorer. You can select from amongst any of the properties that appear in the Details tab.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hey Dijji,&lt;br&gt;
many thanks for your quick reply and for the technological clarification. It is the "tags" (System.Keywords) I am mostly interested in. My question above was not about where to see all possible and/or existing tags or properties for a given file,
 but rather to be able to see all existing tags on my machine (for any file) and to manage/organize them: delete, rename, etc.&lt;br&gt;
If I want to use tags for classification, (with the ultimate goal to enhance search) I need to be able to manage them somehow. The type ahead feature for tags is cool, but only if I get useful recommendations (tags I find useful). Otherwise those keywords are
 not any more useful than full-text, e.g. as in commentaries.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Is there any way to see all existing tags (System.Keywords) on my machine and manage them? (e.g. in the registry or somewhere?)&lt;br&gt;
I suspect renaming won't be possible (for this the managing tool/file would need to know which files all have a given property - but at least being able to delete unwanted tags would help. Otherwise it is just text.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Your clarification is much appreciated.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Best regards!&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;If you go into the File Association Manager, and press the Custom Profiles button, then all the property groups and properties currently defined on the system are shown in the controls labelled Property Groups and Properties. ‘System.’ needs to be added
 to the front of each of the names shown (except System) to get the full official name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The File Association Manager populates these controls using the system API PSEnumeratePropertyDescriptions. This is one of a family of APIs that allows you to manipulate the properties defined in the system. PSRegisterPropertySchema, for instance, allows you
 to define a new custom property. It is worth noting, however, that there are no APIs that allow you to modify existing system properties in any way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As far as I know, this is the only way to interact with the system property definitions. I don’t know where these definitions are ultimately held.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thanks for the great work.&lt;br&gt;
I was looking for a organizer utility too.&lt;br&gt;
Because the system language is not English and my poor English, sometimes I cant find/associate the property name in explorer and its System.Property name, so, could the Custom Profile Definition shows the local name as shown in explorer column? Or, is there
 any utility can query the name between the two namespace?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

File Meta does not at present have any capability for setting the Kind associated with an extension. How important would this be as a new feature?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the meantime, you can add it yourself with a single registry setting per extension, as described at

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank You for this magnificient tool which finally opens up whole (nearly) metadata functionality.
&lt;br&gt;
Am about to start tagging my collections of documents and photos, but have already experienced metada loss due to mail transmmission and other pdf reader incompatibility. Therefore am curious, if (based on Your knowledge) metadata stored in the way NTFS file
 system does is in line with ReFS file system and will be easy to adjust to this newer standard as it becomes more popular?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
ReFS does support alternate streams, but I cannot discover whether it implements a property store that uses them for storage, as NTFS does. This is of course the key mechanism that File Meta uses to store meta data.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Assuming for the moment that ReFS does support such property stores, it would mean that you could run File Meta unchanged over ReFS drives. However, this would do nothing to mitigate the metadata losses that you have experienced, because these are caused not
 by storage problems, but by the fact that in most scenarios where the file is moved or copied outside NTFS, the meta data associated with the file is not transmitted, or, as you say, conflicting property handlers.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the case where ReFS does not support property stores over alternate streams, it might be possible to update File Meta to use an alternative storage mechanism. However, doing so would again not mitigate the metadata loss issue, for similar reasons. In fact,
 life would be worse unless, like NTFS, ReFS kept the metadata store with the file throughout its own world.

Could you say a little more about what you mean by “does not show up”. Are you saying, for instance, that the Title field does not appear in Explorer, or perhaps that it does not contain the title from the PDF file, or that you cannot edit the Title field?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hmm. There are actually three places in Explorer where Title might not be appearing: in the Details pane; in a column added to the main display, is it that; and in the Details tab of the Properties dialog for a file. I am going to assume the most likely
 case, which is that it is appearing in none of them. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have attempted to reproduce your problem on my test machines, without success. Everything works as I would expect. I wonder if the issue is with your configuration.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, when you open Association Manager, and select the .pdf extension, what profile is selected in the combo box on the left? Also, does System.Title appear in the Preview Panel and Details tab panes on the right-hand side of the screen?
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;OK, this is getting really weird. &lt;br&gt;
I was using PDF-XChange Viewer as my default viewer. After uninstalling and setting Adobe as the default, the Title field does come up. The issue though is that it shows as blank, even though there is info within the document, as seen under Properties. Then
 I added a nominal new Title, via Explorer at the bottom, this shows up in Explorer but is different to the info in the document itself as found under Properties. I have an Excel spreadsheet which reads the data and it showed me the new nominal Title.
&lt;br&gt;
I then reinstalled PDF-XChange Viewer and once again have the same issue as the original post ... Title not showing in Explorer. Ran my Excel macro and this time got the original Title property within the document.
&lt;br&gt;
Issue applies to Details view and the bottom area of Explorer. These do not match as seen under Properties by right-clicking or viewing within the reader.
&lt;br&gt;
Have tried uninstalling-reinstalling readers and File Association Manager, no luck.
&lt;br&gt;
What is going on?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Okay, now things are getting much clearer. The thing to remember is that there are two places where properties can be saved.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One is embedded in the document itself. PDF files have a place for storing the Title defined in the format. Of course, not all files do e.g. .txt files. Equally, PDF files cannot store all properties, e.g. PDF files cannot store the Comment property within
 the file. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The other storage location is in an annex to the file, which is where File Meta stores properties. This has the merit of working for all file types, but the drawback that the properties are only moved automatically with the file when it is moved around within
 NTFS drives. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now we come to the question of what you see in Explorer. Explorer uses plug-ins called property handlers to access properties. Which property you see depends where the property handler looks. File Meta installs a property handler that looks in the annex to
 the file. PDF-XChange installs, by default, PDF-XChange Shell Extensions, which almost certainly includes its own property handler that looks at the Title property within the PDF file. Thus, you see different titles depending what is installed.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
File Meta 1.5 supports extending third-party property handlers, so here is an option that might suit you. First, uninstall PDF-XChange, and use the Association Manager to remove the File Meta handler for the PDF extension (uninstalling File Meta has no relevant
 effect). Then reinstall PDF-Xchange. Now, when you open the Association Manager, the PDF extension should show up as having an existing handler. You can then add the File Meta handler on top of it. This should have the effect of showing the Title from the
 PDF file in Explorer, but allowing you to change this and any other properties without changing the PDF file at all. For further explanation about how all this works, see the Documentation.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thanks for the comprehensive reply. &lt;br&gt;
The solution in the last paragraph works, and now lets me edit the Title field. &lt;br&gt;
Am I correct in understanding that metadata is not embedded in the file? My PDF files will be used across various computers in the future, at work, at home, etc. which may or may not be NTFS. Also I use PDF-XChange Viewer and Adobe interchangeably. By the sounds
 of it each stores metadata in different ways. &lt;br&gt;
Would there be any other way around using an annex file?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;No, if you use File Meta, the Title property is not stored inside the PDF file, which it is if you edit the Title within a PDF editor. Instead, it is stored in an invisible annex to the file. If you want the Title to be stored inside the PDF file, do not
 use File Meta. It may be that PDF-XChange Shell Extensions includes a property handler that will show the Title property in Explorer and allow you to edit it. If it does, it will almost certainly be storing the value inside the PDF file, if it doesn’t, as
 the thread points out, there are various other PDF specific solutions that will do these things.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To go back to using the property handler supplied by PDF-XChange Shell Extensions, assuming there was one, just use the Association Manager to remove the File Meta handler from the PDF extension.

&lt;br&gt;
I have just installed and tried "File Metadata", and I LOVE THIS, I planned to reduce FOLDER STRUCTURE (ie, less chance of "Destination Path Too Long Error When Moving/Copying a File" ERROR)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you think this can be use for Folder structure organising method? or do you think, this is too risky?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
__ what I like about it:__&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is easy to use &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It fixed and edit metadata on unsupported files (ie. .Dwg, .Txt, .skp) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The metadata is saved within the file itself. (I tested on 2-3 computer and metadata is saved on the file and not via app's cache) - all you have to do is to have "File Metadata" installed and activate the metadata
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It also fixed all previously un-editable tags.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once file format activated, search engine be able to understood and filter basing&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I’m glad you like the software. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Before you bet your computing life on it, however, you need to be fully aware of what it does. File Meta does not store properties within the file itself, but in an annex to the file. This is fully transparent as long as you stay within an NTFS world: you can
 copy and move files around freely, including over networks, and the metadata will be carried with the file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, when you step outside NTFS, support is limited. If you copy to a FAT formatted drive, or send a file as an email attachment, the meta data is lost. Some NAS drives preserve metadata and some don’t, even when they present as NTFS. You also need to check
 whether metadata is preserved when you do things like zip a file up; again some software does and some doesn’t.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Personally, if I were depending absolutely on File Meta metadata I think I would be making sure that my world was all NTFS drives (internal or USB) as far as possible, and using the XML export features regularly (especially the command line support) to make
 an independent backup of the metadata, knowing that I would then be able to reapply it to the files whatever else happened.&lt;br&gt;

If that looks good, can you set the meta data on some previously untagged PDF file from within Explorer?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;First off, thanks for this great software! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My questions is: how can I allow the users on my server (just a PC running Windows 10), who connect through RDP, add tags to files on a mapped drive (NAS), and see tags that other users have added?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The catch is likely to be the NAS. These provide their own implementation of NTFS, and some of them support alternate streams, which are required for File Meta, and some don’t. Annoyingly, their sales material does not typically let you know about this either
 way. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can confirm where the issue is by breaking the path into stages, i.e. first using RDP to access a file on a conventional hard drive, and then accessing a file on the NAS from the Windows UI on your server.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I was overjoyed to read the description of this program, as it would do exactly what I am looking for. Specifically, I wish to modify file metadata for matroska files, as the data in the container is not entirely exposed by the relevant Windows property handler.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sadly, I cannot seem to make the File Metadata program (x64 or x86) work on Windows 10 Pro x64. I get an immediate program crash. Fiddling with the compatibility settings has not helped. Version 1.4 yields the same result.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I certainly hope there is a solution. I've found the way to expose several extra metadata fields in the Details pane of Explorer, but they all read blank (eg Subtitle, Language, Comments). Even if I create similar XML structures following Matroska guidelines,
 no deal. I imagine the reason is that the property handler simply does not read and provide the data. It would be wonderful to be able to populate these fields with the data.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks in advance, &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi William &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is likely to be a problem with the .Net Framework installation on your system, as it looks as though program loading is failing in WPF internals during preparation of the main form.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A first step might be to try the Microsoft .NET Framework Repair Tool at &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30135" rel="nofollow"&gt;
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30135&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let me know if applying this improves things, or doesn’t. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;These are metadata tags held as part of the video file itself, for instance an .mp4 file. File Meta never edits the tags held as part of a file, as it is file format neutral. You need to find a metadata editor specific to the file format that will allow
 you to change these values. &lt;br&gt;

          <Html>
        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;As with some other users, I have tried to remove the handler for .mp4s and .pngs (even .jpgs), before applying the File Meta Property Handler.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since there is a lot of information on the IPropertyStore Handler for Images (for example), which I might need from time to time, can I remove the File Meta Handler using the File Meta Association Manager (1.3), apply the original handler through the registry
 (through, say, a backup), then remove the original handler again through the registry, and re-apply the File Meta Handler... will the metadata I had originally entered through File Meta 1.3 still be intact?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The answer to your question is yes. Removing the File Meta property handler leaves any metadata that you have written intact, and it will still be available when you add the handler again.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You may however like to try the newly released File Meta 1.4, which will continue to read properties using the original property handler as well as write new values using the File Meta property handler. File Meta 1.4 is classed as a beta at the moment, but
 it passes my full test suite and looks pretty solid. All the documentation has already been updated to describe it.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;What, more exactly, does “did not work” mean? Did the set of properties made available for editing in Explorer change when you apply the profile? Is it that the properties were not writable?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also, what are you seeing in the Association Manager? Does it claim to have set up a File Meta + xxx handler for .mpeg? If so, what is the xxx?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And finally, you seem to be implying that things are working as you would expect for other extensions. Is that correct?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It had no effect at all. No new properties were made available. It is as if I had not used the Association Manager to apply the settings, even though when I do apply them, I get asked whether I want to apply the file meta + xxx, where xxx may be the Simple
 or Office DSOfile presets or anything else. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yes, everything is working as it should do for all the file types I have used it for (about 40 file types), except .mpeg files.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I’m having trouble with .mpeg too. I’m on Windows 10, 64-bit, and even without applying the File Meta handler, things don’t seem to work. The only editable property that shows up in the Details panel is the Rating, and attempts to set it fail with permission
 problems. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the Details tab in the Properties dialog, none of the properties appear to be writable.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Exactly the same things happen on a completely clean Windows 10 preview system. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Adding the File Meta handler increases the number of properties that show up In the Details panel, but attempts to set them still fail with permission problems.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There appears to be something special with the way this extension is configured in Windows.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I'm thinking about distributing File Metadata with my own app in order to enhance the searching functionality of the files that are managed with my app. File Metadata tagging functionality would be nice for doing so. However, I would like that the end
 user doesn´t have to associate file extensions with the handlers by himself. I could manage the registry with my app installer but I don't think It's a clean solution. Is there a better way of doing so? A cmd version of the File Meta Association Manager would
 be really nice. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi izalakain &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
No, I don’t think there is a better way of doing this at the moment. Of course, you could use any scripting language driven from your installer, such as Power shell, but I’m not sure that makes much difference. On the positive side, the registry changes are
 simple and safe as long as you are only creating entries for extensions that Windows does not already know about.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, I will consider adding this support as part of the next release, especially as registry updates are likely to get significantly more complicated, since the main target of the release will be to support extending existing property handlers, rather than
 restrict File Meta to cases where there is no existing property handler. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for the suggestion, because I don’t think there is any chance I would have thought of it otherwise.

I should be able to get to it sometime within the next 3 to 6 months, I hope. &lt;br&gt;

I run this project on my own time, without seeking funding, because I’m lucky enough not to need it. I do, however, encourage donation to other projects which might not exist without financial encouragement.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I hope so. I’m just looking at the details of what would have to be done now. I’m thinking of a separate command with three main options, something like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fmam -l&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
to list all of the currently installed File Meta property handlers and their profiles,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fmam –u .ext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
to remove the property handler for an extension, and&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fmam –r –p=profile –d=”\profile definitions.xml” .ext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
to install property handler for an extension, using the specified profile. The profile definitions file would be that created by the File Meta Association Manager as, for example, "C:\Users\MyUser\AppData\Roaming\FileMeta\SavedState.xml"
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Would that meet your requirements? Also, if I can get this done, would you be prepared to help with the later stages of testing it?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I have now completed my testing, posted a new version of 1.5 and upgraded it to beta status. I didn't find any further problems, so the only change from the last alpha version is that I have fixed the version numbering, which wasn’t applied consistently
 to all components. I have now also posted all the source code. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I need this feature to be able to add tags on all PDF files and make it available when searching files. So far everything works great on local files. On network files. It's not working for me.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am trying to make the tags available on network files but up to now I have no success. This is what I have been doing so far.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Test 1 &lt;br&gt;
Add tags on local pdf file. &lt;br&gt;
Copy the file on network drive. &lt;br&gt;
RESULT: file was copied but tags are not. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
TEST 2 &lt;br&gt;
Add tags on file stored on the network &lt;br&gt;
RESULT: Error code 0x80030002: %1 could not be found &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Anyone who have tried this on a network environment? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have tried this on Win7 and Win10 and the result was the same. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The network drive is a Seagate NAS runing Seagate NAS OS4 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks in advance.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As a cross check, I repeated your tests with the network drive supplied by a second windows 10 PC. Everything worked as you would expect: copied properties were preserved, and I could remotely add and edit properties.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I also did a little digging on the web, and found this thread: &lt;a href="http://seotoast.com/copying-image-from-dropbox-to-nas-results-in-property-loss-warning/" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://seotoast.com/copying-image-from-dropbox-to-nas-results-in-property-loss-warning/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It’s not a Seagate NAS, but it is a similar problem. The NAS is simply not storing the alternate stream, in this case one containing some Dropbox properties.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since what File Meta does is store properties in alternate streams (albeit via the support built into NTFS for storing property sets in an alternate stream), if your NAS does not support alternate streams, then there is nothing I can do, any more than I can
 support a drive formatted with FAT.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m sorry, but I really don’t see what I can do to help on this one.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Does it use different thing than tags of office documents because I can tag office documents without a problem. only files that I enabled with file meta is having problem with adding tags on pdf and txt files.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Yes, indeed it does. The ins and outs of it all are described on this documentation page:
&lt;a href="https://filemeta.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=XP%2c%20Vista%20and%20File%20Metadata" rel="nofollow"&gt;
https://filemeta.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=XP%2c%20Vista%20and%20File%20Metadata&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Office tags work because they are stored “inside the file”, as indeed is the case with all Microsoft-supplied property handlers. But the consequence of this is that Windows, out-of-the-box, cannot write metadata for many extension types, e.g. .txt, and even
 when it can, can only write a restricted set of properties i.e. those for which the file format allocates storage. Thus, even if Microsoft supplied a property handler for PDF files, which they don’t, it wouldn’t be able to write a Comment, because the PDF
 format does not define a place to put it. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Note also the comments of a reviewer of the 1.4 beta, who is having no problems when using a Synology NAS. So I guess support just varies from NAS to NAS, though it doesn't seem to be easy to discover which do and which don't support alternate streams.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I couldn't describe my feelings when I found your tool thanks so much for it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Quick question... &lt;br&gt;
While I'm trying to get those properties in a spread sheet through VBA and more particularly using the
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sValue = oDir.GetDetailsOf(objFile, 18)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
it returns "Tags" instead of the value that is "221" &lt;br&gt;
It will be much appreciated if I can have a comment or suggestion from you &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks in advance! &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Very interesting. I’ve not tried to get at properties this way. I shall investigate.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
By the way, in case bitness is part of the problem, are you 32 or 64 bit Windows? Office?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The problem reproduces on my system, which is 64 bit Windows with 32-bit Office.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The issue is that File Meta for 64-bit sets up only the 64-bit property handler, but 32-bit Office can only use the 32-bit property handler.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Right now, this can be worked around in two steps:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install File Meta 32-bit as well as 64-bit. In the optional components dialog, all components other than the property handler should be deselected.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For each extension whose properties are extended, and that did not already have a handler, add an entry to the 32-bit section of the registry specifying the File Meta 32 bit property handler. For instance, for .txt:
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PropertySystem\PropertyHandlers\.txt]
@="{60211757-EF87-465e-B6C1-B37CF98295F9}"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
The Guid is always the same, just the extension (= the key name) varies. Note, if the key for an extension already exists and has a value, you should leave it alone, as this means it already has a handler.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you can confirm that this is indeed the problem, and this workaround fixes it, maybe it’s not too late to get this into 1.4.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I have just modified my previous post to make it clear that the registry change should only be applied to extensions that did not previously have a handler. This would almost always be true if you are using File Meta 1.3, but it is a good idea to check
 anyway, using the Registry editor. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The more I think about this, the more convinced I become that I should fix the lack of 32-bit property access on 64-bit systems. So I am currently working on an updated release that supports this.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Within a couple of days I should have a test release that you can try to see if it fixes your problem without all the registry hacking described above. I think it highly likely that it will.

Thanks for the reply I appreciate much your effort. &lt;br&gt;
I will wait for your release to test this first then, if still I have the issue I will try your tip with the registry just for proofing it.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Okay, I have created a new download you to try, File Meta 1.5. To use this, do the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uninstall the existing version of File Meta, and install File Meta 1.5 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open File Association Manager, and for each extension that you want to test, do the following:
&lt;br&gt;
a) Select the extension &lt;br&gt;
b) Make a note of the profile currently being used for the extension &lt;br&gt;
c) Click on Remove Property Handler &lt;br&gt;
d) Select the extension, select the profile you just made a note of, and click on Add Property Handler&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
At this point, your VBA macro should start working correctly. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To go back to your previous version of File Meta:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open File Association Manager, and for each extension that you tested, click on Remove Property Handler
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uninstall File Meta 1.5, and install the previous version of File Meta &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open File Association Manager, and for each extension that you tested, select the extension, select the profile that you made a note for that extension, and click on Add Property Handler&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Do let me know what you find. I have tested this on Windows 7 and Windows 10, both where a previous version of File Meta was installed, and where it wasn’t, and it looks pretty solid.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm only sending this as I cannot see my previous post. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The 1.5 release seems to work fine with my macro on Win10 x64Bit with M.Office 2016 x32Bit.
&lt;br&gt;
I do get all the meta data from word &amp;amp; pdf files without any issue. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Great Job! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now after change back to 1.3 for obvious reasons I'm going back to a slightly different issue.
&lt;br&gt;
When I run my macro it gives me blank instead of the property name but I think this is on me as I've changed some lines on my macro.
&lt;br&gt;
So, please consider that the actual issue is that the vba code returns "".
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Please keep in mind the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1.3 &amp;amp; 1.5 release when I use a macro to copy files to a destination the pdf copied files missing the metadata. However when I do this manually ctrl+c &amp;amp; ctrl+v the metadata are there, Funny isn't it?
&lt;br&gt;
-When I removed the 1.5 and reinstalled the 1.3 the meta data appeared again on the window explorer . I assume this is good.
&lt;br&gt;
-When I r-clicked on a word file to add more tags my code found those changes. Another win!
&lt;br&gt;
So, now...shall we wait for a more formal version of the 1.5 release or I can use this as long as it works?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;That’s excellent. Thank you for trying the 1.5 release out. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Feel free to continue using it. I think it’s pretty stable, and the only change that I am considering in that area is to add a button to the File Association Manager to refresh the configuration, so that you don’t have to go through the steps of removing and
 adding handlers manually to update the registry settings for 1.5. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It will be a week or two before the official release, though, because I’m working on adding command line support for the File Association Manager operations to the final release of 1.5. But when it comes, it should be completely compatible.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m not sure I fully understood your final bullet. It sounds as though metadata is disappearing and appearing unexpectedly as you copy files in different ways, depending on whether you read the properties using File Explorer or VBA. Is there anything there
 I should be looking at fixing in 1.5? &lt;br&gt;

B. ... if a batch file loops through a list of folders, sets the tags for each folder, saves the xml file and imports the tags for all files
&lt;br&gt;
C. ... if a batch file loops through a list of files in a folder &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
CALL %_filemeta% -i -x=propsfolder1.xml .folder1*.*&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;A. No, it is not possible. I did consider exporting and importing all data for all files in a folder to a single XML file. Eventually, I decided against doing it because of the cases where the set of files in the folder was changed. For instance, it wasn’t
 clear what to do if one of the imports in a shared XML file referenced a file that no longer existed in the target folder. Would that abort the operation? Be silently ignored? I couldn’t think of any sound precedent, so I stuck to maintaining the same cardinality.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
B, C. I’m not quite sure what you mean by these cases. At the moment, you can of course use wild cards for files or batch iterators to loop through files and folders, for example the equivalent:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CALL %_filemeta% -e -f=temp *.txt &amp;gt; nul || goto error&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
and&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FOR /f %%G IN ('dir /b *.txt') DO (
  CALL %_filemeta% -e -f=temp %%G &amp;gt; nul || goto error )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Zertag &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The first thing to do is to check that the folder containing your file is being indexed. Go to Indexing Options in the control panel and make sure that your folder is included in the indexed locations.

&lt;br&gt;
I realized that the problem was limited to PDF files and after some trial and error, I figured out the fix.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tested on: File Meta v1.3 and v1.4; Windows 10 (x64)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to 'Indexing Options' and select 'Advanced' &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the 'Advanced Settings' window, go to the 'File Types' tab. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scroll down to PDF. Select the 'Index Properties Only' radio button (NOT 'Index Properties and File Contents')&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
This solved the problem. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Best, &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
It’s not uncommon for this sort of error to occur when you have first set up an extension for metadata. Does it still occur after you have restarted Explorer, or rebooted?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If so, can you give me a little more detail about the extension involved and exactly when in the property writing process the error occurs (e.g. during edit, or when you actually apply the update)?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Sorry was away for a while. &lt;br&gt;

There is no problem during the 1st setup &amp;amp; 1st time entering value into all properties. But, this error keep prompting when I try to re-enter different value after click Save. Meaning that I can only key-in 1 time value into the field. The only option i
 have is to click "SKIP" and all value remain unchanged... &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I’ve not seen or heard of anything like this before. Here’s a few things to try to help pin this one down:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, if you update a property that you have already set, it fails. What happens if you then set the same property for the first time on a different file with the same extension? Does it make any difference if the second file has a different extension?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What happens if, after an error on one file, you update a property that you previously set on a different file with the same extension? Does it make any difference if the second file has a different extension?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does it have to be within the same instance of Explorer? What happens if you kill all instances of Explorer.exe after you set a property for the first time, but before you try and update it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Can you also let me know which properties and extensions you used?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I get the same thing. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It is because of settings in the property metadata held by the system. If you look at the property description for System.Document.RevisionNumber, which is the property concerned, here:
&lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb760634(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb760634(v=vs.85).aspx&lt;/a&gt; you will see that the isViewable property of typeInfo is set to false.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then if you look at &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773889(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773889(v=vs.85).aspx&lt;/a&gt; the isViewable property is described as follows:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Public. Optional. Default value is "false". Specifies whether this property is intended to be viewable to the user. For example, the Column Chooser UI only shows the properties that have isViewable="true".
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, Revision Number appears in the Details tab if you right click on the file and choose Properties, and you can set a value there, but it does not show up as a choosable column in Explorer.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I know of no way that the user can modify a system property schema, or even any way that a developer can do it. Custom properties (that is, newly invented properties that you add to the system) can be added or removed (PSRegisterPropertySchema and PSUnregisterPropertySchema),
 but even they cannot be modified (PSRefreshPropertySchema is defined but not supported).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I don’t even know where the system property information is stored. The property description files for installed custom properties appear to be pointed to by HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PropertySystem\PropertySchema, but there’s
 nothing in the registry about system properties that I know about. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
It sounds like you just need to scroll further down the list of extensions. File Meta will not add its handler to any extension that already has a handler, and the extensions list is sorted as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensions with the File Meta property handler (you won’t have any of these) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extensions with a property handler provided by Microsoft or other installed software
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extensions without a property handler&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
You need to select an extension in the third category before the "Add File Meta Handler" button will be enabled.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello Dijji - many thanks and kudos for a great utility. Like others I have been looking for a workable solution to this since XP! Very nice.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Just thought I would mention ... &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I use pdf-xchange viewer as my default viewer. &lt;br&gt;
So naturally their property handler was in place. &lt;br&gt;
In HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PropertySystem\PropertyHandlers.pdf,
&lt;br&gt;
I copied the GUID used by filemeta over the one used by xchange viewer. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Back in filemeta association manager the .pdf extension was now in bold at the top of the list, but without and properties showing.
&lt;br&gt;
So I clicked remove handler and then add handler then restart explorer and voila.
&lt;br&gt;
I even have comments available for pdfs! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I guess I could have just deleted the GUID assigned by xchange viewer ... &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Its very subtle that filemeta doesn't touch property handlers assigned to other apps.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, thanks!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
As you say, just deleting the GUID assigned by xchange viewer would have done the trick.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think the major focus for the next release will be doing something for the cases where there is an existing property handler. Best bet so far looks to be writing all new property values using the File Meta handler, but reading original values using the existing
 property handler if no File Meta value yet exists. As you will see immediately from this explanation, this approach is in danger of being even more subtle, but I’ve yet to figure out or hear of anything better.
&lt;br&gt;

I like that new idea, because in some cases where a property handler exists, one may want to tweak the list of properties offered.

I have no doubt you will come up with a fine solution! &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi AntenRoy &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
if you go to a file in Explorer which has the File Meta property handler configured for its extension, and right click on it, then the Metadata menu item will be shown, and if you open its submenu, one of the available commands is Delete, which removes all
 meta data from the file. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This will only work for meta data stored using File Meta. Are you thinking that I should support the deletion of meta data stored in other ways?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also, when it comes to editing existing meta data, what are you proposing that is different from the current Explorer support, and why? When I was writing File Meta, I deliberately set out to make it work with the in-place editing capabilities of Explorer,
 because I thought they were pretty good. What would be better? &lt;br&gt;

I was bit confused on how the tool works. Now I got it on how the tool works. Thanks again for clarifying :)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I was assuming that the tool will simply remove "file properties and personal information" for any type of file stored in Windows OS. I was lazy and did not check the tool properly.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I just discovered this project and gave it a try, I wanted to ask a couple of questions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I started by enabling my .dwg and .dxf file for metadata. It looks like Autocad behaves like some file editors so that when you open the file and save it, you lose the metadata information. Is there any workaround or solution for this kind of problem ?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also, I wanted to know if,like in our case, there´s a SVN repository, metadata will be shared among all the people checking out from that repository.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Last, I would like to know how to add metadata to a folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Regards&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi José &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There is no general workaround: if the editor does not preserve the alternate stream on update, the metadata is inevitably destroyed. However, it is possible to preserve it by exporting it to XML, and then re-importing it after the update. As I provide command
 line support for these operations, import and export can be performed using a batch file or other scripting language external to the tool, or invoked from within the tool itself, if the tool provides a sufficiently powerful macro language.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Similarly, whether the metadata is preserved in an SVN repository depends on how the repository implements file copy i.e. whether its file copy preserves the alternate stream or not, so for any particular implementation it is a matter of try it and see. Again,
 there is a possible workaround in cases where the alternate stream is not preserved, exporting the metadata to an XML file automatically during check-in, storing the XML file in the repository, and reapplying it automatically during checkout..
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Finally, I know of no mechanism for adding metadata to folders in Explorer. NTFS does support writing metadata to an alternate stream associated with a folder, but the stumbling block has always been that there is no extensibility point that I know of in Explorer
 for adding a User Experience on top of it. If I ever discover or hear about such a mechanism, I will cheerfully add it to the implementation, as folder metadata is something I would dearly like to have myself.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m sorry, I don’t feel that any of these answers are particularly positive, but they do reflect my best current understanding.

&lt;br&gt;
First of all I must say I find your work very interesting and would be willing to use it on my daily work provided I could overcome some of the drawbacks. Mostly I work with binary files, usually either Autocad files or 3d design software like Solidworks. I
 made a couple of tries and both Autocad and SW showed the same result, meaning when you save the file after modifying it, the metadata is lost. Actually I would be happy to be able to modify just one of the properties: "Comments". This way I could
 put a a comment on every file and would not need to open it to know it´s content.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We have been using SVN for at least the last 5 or 6 years now. SVN has it´s own internal mechanism to add metadata, in SVN´s terms they are called "properties". You can use both predefined properties as well as your own defined properties. If you
 want to commit a file to the repo, you need to save if first (modify the file). However when you save it, windows metadata are recreated (I assume) so that all the metadata which is not usually written from within the software you are using is lost. I guess
 that´s where the "sufficiently powerful macro language" comes in. What I did now was : I added a new property fo a file (without touching the file itself). If you do that, you can make a commit operation. I comitted to the repo and checked the file
 out in a different machine. The result was: I could not see the modified Windows metadata on the other machine. My idea is that probably SVN knows the file has not changed, so that is why it only commited the file´s properties, not the file itself, so I am
 really not sure what is going on. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The problem with SVN´s properties is than they can not be added to Windows explorer bar, so if you want to know which are the file´s properties then you must right-click on the file and open the properties manager, which is not a good way to quickly identify
 files you are looking for. I think what is needed is to add. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My question is: would it be possible to add a new shortcut to Windows standard "Save as" dialog box, this way you could implement an application which saves metadata, saves the file, and then adds the saved metadata to the file. I am not a computer
 ileterate but have not done it before so I would not know how to do it. I am thinking of something like this

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi José &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The link you give is about configuring additional items in the Explorer context menu using the registry. It works because Explorer looks for these registry entries and uses them when building context menus.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The File Save dialog, although it is a standard dialog, is controlled by the editing application, e.g. Autocad, and so, if there were a way to extend the dialog, it would be by configuring Autocad.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As you point out, Subversion holds file and folder properties in a store separate from the file itself. So if you make a versioned property change, you can commit that without any changes to the file itself. Then, pulling the update to another machine should
 update the property, but not the file. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The ideal solution would be for Subversion properties to be displayable in Explorer. It would be possible to do this by writing a property handler similar to that in File Meta, but using Subversion as the backing property store. Also, when you edited a property
 in Explorer it would make a versioned change to an underlying Subversion property. However, this would be a new project, beyond the current scope of File Meta.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Short of that, it might be possible to come up with a workaround that copies properties from Subversion to NTFS (where File Meta can access them), and from NTFS to Subversion, at appropriate times. One approach would be to use batch files that read and wrote
 the appropriate properties, and invoke them manually from context menus. Another would be to try and find a way of invoking the same operations automatically before and after Subversion checkin and checkout (do you use one of the Subversion front ends to perform
 these functions?). I’m not quite convinced, however, that such an approach can be made reliable enough to be usable in production.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji, thanks for the feedback.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We use TortoiseSVN as a GUI interface with Subversion. I am familiar with how you can perform some of the operations from a dos screen or linux terminal, but to be quite honest I would have to check the right syntax before, it´s been a while since I have not
 done anything without TortoiseSVN. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you only install the SVN client, you can do all the operations you need from the command line. However, if you install TortoiseSVN, the context menu changes (for all Windows applications as far as I know) so than when you right click on a file you can perform
 some other operations, for example an SVN commit. Actually what we do is: open the file, work with it, Save it and then perform the commit from within the application itself using "Save as - Right Click - Svn Commit". I was thinking that maybe adding
 another step before the "Save" operation could allow you to perform the saving of the metadata on a temporary file. Have a look
&lt;a href="https://tortoisesvn.net/ExplorerIntegration.html#contextmenus" rel="nofollow"&gt;
https://tortoisesvn.net/ExplorerIntegration.html#contextmenus&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to see how the context menu for Tortoise looks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However I find your last paragrah very interesting and maybe something we could explore, let me explain:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In SVN, there´s something called "Repository hooks" which are meant to be executed before and after you do either an update or commit. Again, I should read again because I know they are there but never used them.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Basically the idea (if it works) would be to use one of Subversion properties, to be completed through the standard SVN mechanism, and write a hook script to make SVN copy one (or more) of it´s properties to one of Windows metadata after each commit or update.
 There will be a time when you are working on something that the info will be missing in Windows (after you perform a local save) but once you commit or update the file it will be back there, provided someone has written the needed property in SVN before, otherwise
 it would be blank. I think this would be easier (and stronger) than telling people they should execute a batch file before saving the file, or trying to mess with Autocad Save mechanism, which I imagine is not possible.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One thing SVN is missing (at least as far as I know) is the ability to find a file based on it´s properties, so for example in my case if I defined a property called "comment" in SVN, and used it to rewrite Windows "comment" metadata, I
 would not be able to find a specific file (or files) that match a particular property. As far as Windows search is concerned ( I am using Windows 7), standard search is based on the file name, but you can also search by Class, Modify Date and Type if you click
 on the search Icon on the right top of the screen (I am translating from my Spanish version so maybe some of the terms used are not right). Is it possible to perform a search based on some of the metadata also ?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I will look into the hooks stuff and let you know if it would be possible to do what you are proposing using a hook.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi José &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
if the folder containing your files is currently being indexed (see Indexing Options in the Control Panel), then your files are already being indexed automatically using metadata such as Tags and Comments. You can therefore find files using simple text searches.
 Of course, you can also use Explorer advanced searches to look only for comments e.g. comments:=aaa in the search box will look for files with the comment aaa, or comments:~=aaa will look for files with aaa anywhere in the comment (see
&lt;a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Advanced-tips-for-searching-in-Windows" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Advanced-tips-for-searching-in-Windows&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To access Windows metadata properties from scripts, the thing you need is DSOFile. This is a Microsoft download that lets you read and write properties. You can get it from
&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8422" rel="nofollow"&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Xikul&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In Windows 10, EXE, FLV and MP4 file types are all configured with Windows supplied property handlers, so it is not possible to add the File Meta property handler to these types using the Association Manager. So what types are you adding the File Meta property
 handler to?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On my Windows 10 x64 system, I have the File Meta property handler configured for.txt and.pdf files, and I do not see the same symptom: file sizes are displayed in the status bar as you would expect, for txt, pdf , EXE, FLV and MP4 file types&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do you find that the problem goes away if you uninstall File Meta?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;To be able to add the File Meta property handler to these types using the your File Association Manager, I'd deleted keys in

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;So, to confirm what you’re saying, when you removed the File Meta property handler using the Association Manager, size information started appearing in the status bar again?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note that doing this will not restore the Windows property handler, but leave the file type without any property handler registered at all. To restore the Windows property handler, you would need to restore the deleted property handler registry key manually.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I can’t add the file type to the status bar. I don’t directly display anything in Explorer, all I do is to set registry keys to list the properties that should be shown in the details pane, and the details tab in the properties dialog. I have recently discovered
 that I could also be setting a registry key to list the properties that should be shown in the infotip you see when you hover over a file, but I don’t currently set it. I don’t know of anything that I could do within my current scope to influence what is shown
 in the status bar. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Some Explorer extensions do modify what the status bar shows, so this is a possible factor. Do you have any other extensions installed?

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Can we try looking at file type for which Windows does not define a property handler? Let’s go for .txt. First, confirm that the size of the txt file is shown when selected. Then use the Association Manager to add the File Meta property handler for .txt files,
 and restart Explorer. Does the size of the txt file still show in Explorer? If not, when you remove the File Meta property handler and restart Explorer, does it come back?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Okay, after much wrestling with tracing calls to property handlers and general messing about, there appears to be a simple solution. PreviewDetails needs to include System.Size
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The easiest way to do this is to remove the handler, and add it again with the Office profile. Alternatively, you could create a Custom profile as desired. I will add System.Size to the Simple profile in my next release.

Great. With Office profile (or my Custom profile), now I was able to monitor my works in the best way.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
//One other question: For all Media types (mp4, avi, flv, mp3, mkv...), could Explorer shows their
&lt;strong&gt;duration&lt;/strong&gt; on StatusBar? And if I select multi-file, Explorer shows total their duration?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Going by results so far, you need to have System.Media.Duration included in PreviewDetails, which would require a custom profile. However, this will only be of use if you write a value to that property: the File Meta property handler will just return the
 empty value otherwise. The Windows default property handlers for media files supply the value by examining the contents of the file. Unlike File Meta, they are written to support specific file types and file formats.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I'd prefer Explorer shows MediaTypes's DURATION on StatusBar. Can Explorer do this? Like this screenshot:

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I’m sorry, I misunderstood. I thought you were saying that Explorer does show the duration in the status bar for media files, and wondering if it could be applied to other types. But actually, Explorer doesn’t: it shows the size of the media file, just
 as for other types. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I don’t know any way of getting Explorer to show additional fields in the status bar. As far as I know, its selection of fields is hard-coded, though, as we now know, you can cause the Size to be omitted by leaving it out of the PreviewDetails registry setting.
 I don’t know any way of adding to the fields shown, though. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I just installed File Metadata 1.3 (64 bit) on my Windows 7 Pro (64 bit computer).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Installation went fine. This truly is a worthwhile addition, and it is too bad that M'soft did not include the function after XP.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I set it up initially for .txt files, and chose 'Simple'. I am able to add the metadata information with no problem. Right clicking on the file, and opening the Details tab shows what I added (Title &amp;amp; Comments). Also, I added a 'Comments' column to Explorer,
 and in Detail mode my comments appear. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But hovering over the file does not show either the Metadata properties (Title &amp;amp; Comments) or the text I entered. Likewise, nothing appears in the preview area at the bottom of Explorer when I click on the file.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I don't think it is a problem with my Explorer, because when I hover or click on your .msi file that I downloaded, all that information appears as it should.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I rebooted my computer, but that made no difference. Any idea what the problem might be?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also, when I open the Association Manager, at the bottom left is a button which says 'Restart Explorer'. Exactly what does that do? Are you only closing and reopening Explorer, or something more?
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Harry &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
it sounds as though things are working fine, by and large, as demonstrated by the fact that you can set properties and have them displayed in the details tab of the properties dialog for files, such as text files, on which this would not normally be possible.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So you should not need to reboot, or restart Explorer, nor would I expect doing so to make any difference. By the way, killing all instances of explorer.exe, and restarting it, is exactly what the Restart Explorer button in the File Association Manager does.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As far as I know, the fact that the properties do not show up when you hover over a file is expected behaviour. I do not know of anything that can modify the set of properties that Explorer shows there. But I would expect the properties to show up in the Details
 Pane, which does indeed by default show up at the bottom of the Explorer window in Windows 7. I have posted screenshots of what you would expect to see in both Windows 7 and Windows 8 and later in the documentation
&lt;a href="https://filemeta.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=What%20you%20see" rel="nofollow"&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt; . However, you mention looking in the Preview Pane, which is a different area, and shows the content of the file rather than its properties. What version of Windows are you on, and can you confirm that the Details Pane is being displayed?

I have Windows 7 Pro SP1 (64 bit). I run a utility called Classic Explorer, so my view of Windows Explorer is not the standard. Also my terminology is probably not correct. So I have created 5 images, and I will explain them in the terms I used in my post.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go here: &lt;a href="http://www.ottawapark.org/reference/images/FileMetada_1E.png" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://www.ottawapark.org/reference/images/FileMetada_1E.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are blue numbers in the upper right corner.&lt;br&gt;
1 Is a .txt file that I modified with File Metadata named MapMarkerstring2.txt. I have right clicked on the file, selected Properties, and the Detail tab. That is what I called the Detail tab in my post. You can see that I added a Title, and Comments. I also
 added a Comments column to Explorer, and the red underline shows that my comments are correctly displayed in that column.&lt;br&gt;
2 is what I see when I hover over MapMarkerstring2.txt. Neither my Comments or my Title are displayed here.&lt;br&gt;
3 is what is displayed on the bottom line of Explorer in the red box (I call that the Preview area). Neither my Comments or my Title are displayed here.&lt;br&gt;
4 is what I see when I hover over the file I downloaded from your site: FileMeta 1.3(x64).msi. All of the information that you added (Authors, Title, etc.) is shown here. The Comments are shown in Explorer (red underline on the right.)&lt;br&gt;
5 is what is displayed on the bottom line of Explorer in the red box. All of the information that you added (Authors, Title, etc.) is shown here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hopefully this will give you a better understanding of the problem that I am having, and will aid in providing some ideas as to what might be causing the problem.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Harry &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you very much, the screenshots help a great deal. I think I can now see exactly what you are talking about.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
File Meta does two things, in essence. Firstly, it configures the standard Windows property system to store metadata properties on specified file types. Secondly, it configures Windows Explorer (via registry settings) to show the properties in the selected
 profile in the properties dialog and the Details Pane. As far as I know, Explorer does not offer a similar mechanism for extending the properties shown when hovering over a file, or in the bar across the bottom of the window.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Classic Explorer is an extension to Windows Explorer. However, it is not obviously involved with the display of additional properties in the properties dialog, which appears to be working as normal.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am wondering about whether the Details Pane also works as normal. In the standard Windows Explorer, the way to show the Details Pane is to go to the View tab, and turn the Details Pane on. The Details Pane shows properties in columns of name value pairs,
 and allows you to edit the values in place, as shown in the screenshots linked to in my previous reply. Certainly, for me, the Details Pane is the best feature in the Explorer experience.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After that, however, we have probably reached the limits. If Classic Explorer had a way of extending Explorer to allow the configuration of additional properties to show when hovering or in the status bar, I would probably not want to use it (unless of course,
 the settings were also consumed by standard Windows Explorer, which would be nice!)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I hope that this makes things clearer, if not better. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Again, thanks for your diligent response. The problem is partially solved. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Years ago, when I first installed Windows 7, I bought a comprehensive manual. So I pulled it out again to better understand what you are talking about. In Explorer, under the Organize tab, I found that the Details pane was NOT selected. I selected, it, and
 now I see what you are seeing in the Details pane for all my File Metadata created files, as well as files that Windows already allowed to have comments, such as music, Office, etc.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But on my computers, there is a pane below the Details pane, which Windows calls the Status Bar, and is set on the View dropdown (the Status Bar is shown in the red boxes on screenshots 3 &amp;amp; 5 on the attachment I sent). Classic Explorer has the option for
 the Status Bar to display the SAME information as what one sees when one hovers over a file.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
File Metadata does NOT, at least for me, display ANY info that I added with File Metadata either in the hover display (screenshot 2), or on the Status Bar (screenshot 3). For files that Windows has allowed to have comments, etc., the information is displayed
 when hover (screenshot 4) and on the Status Bar (no screenshot supplied). I don't know if you designed File Metadata to not work with hover &amp;amp; the Status Bar, or if I have a problem.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You might want to look at Classic Shell (which contains Classic Explorer). It is really quite powerful for a free utility. You can find it here:

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Harry&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
No, this is not by design. It has honestly never occurred to me before to look at what is shown when you hover over a file. Poking around, however, it seems this is configured by a registry entry that I did not know about. The properties to show are listed
 in a value called InfoTip, on the same key as the FullDetails and PreviewDetails values that control the properties dialog and Details Pane respectively (currently set by the File Association Manager when the File Meta property handler is configured for a
 file type). . So, for example, for a text file, we might add:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\SystemFileAssociations\.txt]
"InfoTip"="prop:System.ItemType;System.Size;System.Comment;System.Keywords"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This causes the file type and size to be shown with any comment and tag values when a text file is hovered over. Note that the properties in the InfoTip value must be a subset of those in the FullDetails value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I will configure this registry value in a future version of File Meta. For now, you can achieve the effect by adding the registry value manually. I suspect that doing so will also cause the same information to appear in the status bar when using Classic Explorer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do let me know if this works for you, and thank you for putting me onto this.&lt;br&gt;

Works great! In both the Hover window, and on the Status Bar with Classic Explorer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I know very little about the Registry, but with your guidance I was able to stumble around and get it done. (I do know enough to create a Restore Point first.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here is the code that I used:&lt;br&gt;
prop:System.ItemType;System.Title;System.Subject;System.Comment;System.Keywords;System.Author;System.Size;System.DateModified&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Windows already uses Type, Size &amp;amp; Date Modified, so I was not sure if I needed to add them or not, or where they might be placed in the sequence if I did not add them. But what I added seemed to work OK.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I don't know how many of your users take advantage of the Hover window, but I use it all the time. I find when I have similar files, I can slowly move my cursor down the screen, and see what is in each. For me this quicker than clicking on multiple files.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So I encourage you to go ahead and change the code. Hopefully you can set it up so that whatever a user sets as the Metadata properties in the Handler he creates for an extension is added to the InfoTip; just as you do for Preview &amp;amp; Details.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let me know if you include these changes in the update, and if I need to delete what I manually added before I install it.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
That is very good news. You shouldn’t have to remove your manual changes when I make the update. In fact, I’ll probably make your property list the basis for the one I use in the standard profiles, so you shouldn’t see any change at all.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’ll post again here when I make the change. And in the meantime, thank you again waking me up to the possibilities.

After initial testing on my laptop, I installed File Metadata on my desktop (both are Windows 7 PRO (64 bit) OS. As long as I was able to type correctly, it all went fine, including adding the 'InfoTip' line in the Registry.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But I have four questions, based on how I am setting everything up. I'll start with the simple one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not every extension in \SystemFileAssociations\ has the same entries included. I first started with .txt, as you suggested. The entry names that were there initially were: (Default), FullDetails, PerceivedType, and PreviewDetails. Some of the others don't
 have FullDetails and/or PreviewDetails. As long as I have the items I want in InfoTip, AND the properties I want in the File Meta Association Manager, do I care what other entry names are in the Registry extension?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wanted to add some of the Detail tab property entries that were already included before I added the .T14 extension(this is an extension used by a tax software program I have) Look at the attachment. The top image is what the Details tab looks like before
 I added .T14 to File Metadata. I was trying to recreate the 6 items highlighted in red. The bottom image shows the properties I added to the Preview panel and Details tab. The insert (pointed to by the arrow) is what the resulting Details tab has. The DateCreated
 and DateSaved extensions pickup the information like they should have. But the FileName, Type &amp;amp; FilePath did not. They require a manual entry, which is not what I wanted. Did I pick the wrong entries for these Metadata properties? I tried to open the sub
 files on each of the Property entries, but there must be thousands of them! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a list somewhere which contains all of the individual properties? I looked through the forum questions and the FAQ, but could not find anything.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My tax program creates a different file extension each year. There was .T13, .T14, and now T15, etc. Rather than creating a different Metadate file extension, and Registry SystemFileAssociation for each year, will the Registry accept 'wildcard's? That is,
 could I create a SystemFileAssociation entry something like .T1(x), which would them work for every year from 11 through 19?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Thanks again for such a useful utility, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as I know, the system reads explicit registry values, so as long as Infotip, say, is present, it doesn’t matter what else is present or not.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is just a question of picking the right properties. All of the six that you are looking for can be found under System. Setting the first six entries of the Details tab in your custom profile as follows will give you the properties that you describe:&lt;br&gt;
System.ItemNameDisplay&lt;br&gt;
System.ItemTypeText&lt;br&gt;
System.ItemFolderPathDisplay&lt;br&gt;
System.Size&lt;br&gt;
System.DateCreated&lt;br&gt;
System.DateModified &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The properties are all documented, for instance, the System properties are described here:
&lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff521735(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff521735(v=vs.85).aspx&lt;/a&gt; However, this information is rather too detailed, so I tend to just add properties with likely -looking names and see what they do, which is how I found the ones listed above.
 You will find that different properties give different presentations e.g. there are four or five properties in System that describe the item type in a variety of ways.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There used to be some support for wild cards, but it was removed in Vista when they redesigned the property system. It will be necessary to add each tax file extension to File Meta. The good news, however, is that you can of course reuse the same custom
 profile.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Do let me know if this does not address your issues.&lt;br&gt;

Thanks for the detailed response. The items in 2. are perfect! I looked at the msdn.microsoft link, and I have no idea what they are talking about. So your cut and try method seems most appropriate.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am having some problems with 4., reusing a custom profile. I just must not be doing it correctly. I modified the profile for .T14 substituting the entries you have in 2. for what I had. That works great for .T14. So I selected .T15, clicked on Custom Profiles,
 then under Custom, selected .T14. That cloned .T14 into .T15. I clicked OK, and on your main page, .T15 is highlighted, and all the correct new properties are listed in the Preview and Details panels. But as soon as I select another file extension name, and
 then reselect .T15, everything I added from custom .T14 is gone! And they do not appear when I go to Explorer and click on a .T15 file. Any idea what the problem might be?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I also have a more serious problem. The 'InfoTip' changes to the Registry no longer seem to work. I have looked at my registry entries and they appear fine. I have rebooted my computer a few times, and that was no improvement. Any ideas?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
You should only need to go into Custom Profiles once to set up the profile. Say you called it ‘Tax’. Then, when you look at the .T14 extension on the main page, you apply the ‘Tax’ profile to it by selecting it in the combo box at step 2, before you click Add
 File Meta Handler. Then you can do the same for the .T15 extension, applying the same ‘Tax’ profile. There is no need to get into cloning profiles.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I will try out the InfoTip settings on my machines, when I have a moment, and see if they still work.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi! &lt;br&gt;
First I would like to thank you for great application! It helps a lot in organizing huge amount of different file types, and it is perfectly integrated in Windows.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But I have a question, I don't if it is possible, but I hope you can help me here. Is it possible, when I want search files by tags, to get the list of all tags I have used, and then to click on the tag I am searching for? (Why I need this: I could forget all
 tags I have used). &lt;br&gt;
I know that some others tag-applications have their own file managers where you are able to see all tags which have been used.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks in advance! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Best regards, &lt;br&gt;
WF&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi WF &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I don’t know of any way of doing what you are looking for that can be integrated into Windows. File Explorer will volunteer possible values for tags when you type an initial letter while editing the keywords field, based on other tags that you have recently
 entered, for some definition of recently, but it is not a complete list. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have played with ideas for organising files using tags. For instance, I have a prototype which presents files in virtual folders based on the tags that have been applied to them, each virtual folder being named after a tag value. The idea is to be able to
 see all the tags, which files have that tag applied, and be able to manipulate tags by adding files to tag folders or removing them. I went as far as building one variant as an Explorer extension. However, I’ve never been convinced that I came up with enough
 of real interest to make publishing my prototype as open source worthwhile for me and the world. But I would be interested to hear any requirements or ideas that you might have.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thank you for your reply Dijji. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think that your prototype is very good idea! I am someone who is not expert in computers (I don't know how virtual driver are working), but functionality of your idea is something what I am looking for. As I am trying to organize a lot of files. Having access
 to the folder where there are all tags as folders is good solution. And if it is possible to manipulate with folders (tags) it would be great. File Metadata + your virtual folder could definitely be the best taging system for the Windows.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
From my side, I would fully encourage you to publish your work, but I am afraid that is pretty much all I can do.
&lt;br&gt;
I would definitely be interested to try it, and in that sense I could give my comments&amp;amp;suggestions.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Somehow I don't have any problem searching for files with given tags - in the Explorer Details View, the column names have a little arrow on the right which can be expanded to show all the Tags used, for example. Then one or more tags can be checked, acting
 effectively as a convenient filter (not sure if this is a default feature but I can't remember enabling it - I have Windows 7 by the way, managing PDF files). I understand this is what WF was after but the virtual folders is also a nice idea.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, I do have a problem with the Explorer "volunteering possible values for tags when you type an initial letter while editing the keywords field, based on other tags that you have recently entered, for some definition of recently" (quoting Dijji).
 First of all, when I enter a tag, I would definitely like those prompts to appear, otherwise I may end up with a lot of similar tags, which would then ideally need to be 'merged' manually. Now, I have noticed that sometimes I do get those hints and sometimes
 not, or not those that I would expect based on the other PDFs in the same folder. Even the "recently entered" rule does not seem to work, as I enter a new tag, save, then select another file and when I try to add that same tag it is not prompted
 and instead some other suggestions appear which I have actually never defined myself. I guess I just don't understand how this 'volunteering system' works exactly and I wonder if you have any comments on this matter? (although from what you said above this
 is probably something unrelated to File Metadata itself) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Otherwise, I'd like to join all the others congratulating you on the great and useful tool!
&lt;br&gt;
Regards, &lt;br&gt;
Pawel.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi pablo78&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
All the behaviour you describe (the little arrow on the right, and tag value proposals) are indeed standard features of Explorer, with no dependency on File Meta at all. File Meta merely allows you to add tags and other metadata to file types where Windows
 does not support this out-of-the-box. My ‘for some definition of recently’ is just an indication that I don’t know the rules either: I too have noticed that not all tag values are immediately added to the list of proposals - maybe there is some background
 processing involved. One more thought: in Explorer you can search for tags using the advanced search syntax 'keywords:=tagval' to see all the files in the folder subtree with a particular tag.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you or WFreude would like to try my prototype tag viewer, you would be very welcome to do so. It is not ready for publication yet, being at this stage a grab bag of features with no real coherent theme. If I ever do publish it will be free and open source;
 maybe your feedback is what I need to show me the way. To give you an idea of its current functionality, it looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Image" src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=filemeta&amp;amp;DownloadId=1527123"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The panel on the left shows a hierarchy of tags, and the panel on the right shows the files with the currently selected tag. The path at the top is the root of the folder subtree that contains all the tagged files. The idea behind a tag hierarchy is to support
 tagging at different levels of generality, so, for example photographs might be tagged using a country/city/location hierarchy. Then tagging the photograph with a location would also make it findable via the country containing the location. Files are tagged
 by dragging them onto tags, and tags are organised into a hierarchy by dragging them onto each other.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you’re interested, let me know, and I will send you a private message to set up an email contact that I can use to supply you with an installer and a more detailed description.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;An additional comment on managing files using tags. The prototype I described briefly above is actually similar in many ways to
&lt;a href="http://silkwoodsoftware.com/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Elyse&lt;/a&gt;. The biggest difference is that Elyse has its own database, whereas my prototype scans the file system. Elyse therefore scales better, but can lose files if they are kept in the file
 system and moved from one directory to another. Elyse also has more features, such as image preview for photographs. I had thought about achieving similar capabilities by re-implementing my prototype as an extension to Explorer, and showing tags as virtual
 folders. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for the quick reply and your offer to provide the Tag Tree Viewer - and yes I would be happy to be a 'beta tester' for the application so feel free to send me a private message with more info.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I like the idea of the tag hierarchy which does make it easier to manage tags. However, from the screenshot I'm not sure if it is also possible to display files containing an arbitrary combination of tags? (sort of the 'little arrow on the right' idea of the
 Explorer which I find VERY useful). I mean, the hierarchy will usually be interconnected - to use your example, I might want to display all the files for a given location incl. photos, videos, documents etc.
&lt;br&gt;
Also, that issue of getting a list of hints when entering tags is still bugging me somewhat - but I appreciate that it is native to the File Explorer. It would be good to understand it though and ideally import/export tag history etc. - some detective work
 needed! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Regarding your additional comment, I have used Mendeley Desktop which is a powerful PDF organizer and contains a lot of nice features - but somehow I was never sufficiently organized myself to maintain it consistently and this is where I find the advantage
 of your simple Explorer extension. Plus, it makes it easier to share my PDF library between my work and home computers via Dropbox or such like, without space limits of the Mendeley cloud (true, occasionally I need to do xml updating but I can live with that).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Cheers, &lt;br&gt;
Pawel.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I also had a look at Mendeley. As you may have gathered, I got interested in tagging in the first place as a mechanism for organising academic papers, and it is a very powerful tool for the purpose. But, like you, I`m reluctant to buy into the whole database
 thing, which is what led me to see how far I could get without it, building as lightly as possible on what ships in Windows. With luck, you will be able to see what you think of my efforts to date soon.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I registered just to show my support for this app and it's potential.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have music composition software. I have 200gb of sound libraries with stupid names. I mean a collection of synth bass sounds might be named something like "Chronic Deep". I have them categorized alphabetically but that's near useless. This tagging
 lib will be a great help. &lt;em&gt;The virtual folder display would be the ultimate.&lt;/em&gt; Therefore, please include me in the testing of your virtual folder tagging organizering thing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think a Virtual Folder display would be best. Would it be possible to place the "root" of such a hierarchy in the Libraries section? That section has been around since forever, and I've only recently started using it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As far as a data storage, there's a couple things here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First of all, as a user I can tell that the windows search system uses some kind of cache, so a data store of some type may be available.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Secondly, while I can absolutely appreciate the goal using windows core functionality (file metadata), I think you can continue to do that and keep performance high by using a database (sqlite) as a
&lt;em&gt;cache only&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, metadata is used as the permanent store, but the database is used to build and display the tree. In this way the db is not required and the tags will remain with the file during transfer. An initial scan (similar to the
 program Search Everything) would be required to build the cache, but any subsequent usage could be written
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; cached at the time of entry.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For display in &lt;code&gt;My Computer &amp;gt; Libraries &amp;gt; Tags&lt;/code&gt;, I would see it working where the top level shows ALL tags.
&lt;br&gt;
And then, using the Country&amp;gt;province&amp;gt;city example, here's a quick n dirty graphic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Image" src="http://i.imgur.com/Bif3Qlh.png?1"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is basically a flexible AND search. "All items related to Cheyenne AND Wyoming" whether it's files that have only those tags, or other tags that appear with those tags. The deeper you drill, the fewer items listed.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The only way this could be made better is if the file save dialog had a tags field. To save a file, you'd have to enter a filename and at least one tag.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi hiwire03 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’ve not seen this one before. I looked up the error code, and sure enough, it means that it could not find a path. The ‘%1’ is a placeholder for the path it could not find, but, unfortunately it’s not being filled in.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It doesn’t seem likely that the problem is the usual need to restart Explorer, more that there is some sort of problem with installation. I do have a diagnostic tool that I can post for you to download that might give us some more information, if you would
 be prepared to run that for me. Do let me know, and if you are up for it, are you 32-bit or 64-bit?

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;It sounds like you are clicking on the unzipped executable. This will pop up a command window, run the tool, then close again before you can see any output.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The tool needs to be run from the command line, i.e. you need to open a command prompt by typing cmd in the search box and choosing ‘Command Prompt’. Then you need to change to a directory containing the test file on which we're going to set a metadata property.
 For instance, ‘cd Documents’ will take you to your normal documents folder. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then you can say ‘\wherever\PropertyTester.exe test.pdf’ to run the tool against the chosen target file, or if you unzip PropertyTester.exe to the same directory as the target file, just ‘PropertyTester.exe test.pdf’. The output will appear in the command window,
 or you can route it to a log file by saying ‘\wherever\PropertyTester.exe test.pdf &amp;gt; log.txt’.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Excellent, this certainly clarifies things greatly. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
File Meta depends on an NTFS feature to store metadata. How is your flash drive formatted? Many of them ship formatted using FAT, which won’t work.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I've installed File Metadata v1.2 and really like the ability to tag files I couldn't previously; however, I'm having a weird problem. I'm primarily tagging jpg files with the names of the people in them; however, for some reason I'm having problems tagging
 three of them (out of 120 total). When I add the tags and click save, I will actually see the tags appear under the Tags column, momentarily disappear and finally reappear in Windows Explorer. Furthermore, I cannot search the tags assigned to those files (using
 tags:=). Nothing appears to be unique about these files as far as I can tell. Just curious if anyone has ever seen similar behavior. Thanks

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi afc30 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m sorry this reply is late, Codeplex has only just notified me of your post. They’ve had a few issues of late, and I suspect it got caught up in some sort of backlog.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In File Meta Association Manager, what property handler is set up for jpg files? You can find out by looking for the .jpg extension in the listbox headed File Extensions. I’m asking because by default it will be the ‘IPropertyStore Handler for Images’ supplied
 as part of Windows, and File Meta will not replace it unless you do some registry edits first.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If this is the case, then the behaviour you are seeing on jpg files is purely a Windows phenomenon. It would make sense, sort of, too. When Windows writes tags to jpg files, it updates the file itself, by reading the original file, writing a new temporary file
 containing the tags, then removing the original file and renaming the temporary. It does all this in the background, so I can imagine why you might see File Explorer showing old, then none, then new tag values as the background operation proceeds.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I would not expect to see this for extensions handled by the File Meta Property Handler, which uses no background processes.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hope this helps &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Currently on Win8.1x86 ASUS TransformerBook Intel Atom 73735F (Quad) Ram: 2.0GB&lt;br&gt;
FIlemeta: 1.2+1.3Beta&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yadda yadda:&lt;br&gt;
I am a college student with over 500 files organized and sorted using FileMeta.&lt;br&gt;
My old PC has crashed forcing me to switch to a new PC and FM is acting up.&lt;br&gt;
There is an issue with a few stubborn file handlers including: MF MPEG-4 and the Microsoft Office Metdata Handler.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The issue:&lt;br&gt;
I am trying to remove the default handlers and switch to custom ones.&lt;br&gt;
Deleting the registry keys for .Docx .Mp4 .Xlsx .Mp3 Etc..... and creating a new key with the same name does not remove the old handler from the file type.&lt;br&gt;
Its either as if something is re-writing the properties to the new key or FileMeta is not updating it in the Association managers UI for some reason.&lt;br&gt;
Either way its still greys out all FM custom options for the offending file types and thy remain with their default handlers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Information:&lt;br&gt;
I focused on the .Mp4 file type.&lt;br&gt;
The default handler is MF MPEG-4 Property Handler. (Default with windows possibly WMP)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                  V&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Using ShellExView I got this CLSID: &lt;br&gt;
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID{f81b1b56-7613-4ee4-bc05-1fab5de5c07e}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                  V&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Through a sub-directory I found a string linking to this .dll&lt;br&gt;
%SystemRoot%\System32\mfmp4srcsnk.dll&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                  V&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
(These files are all protected by trusted installer)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Attempt1:&lt;br&gt;
Regular key deletion and recreation using regedit.&lt;br&gt;
Unsuccessful (Handler remains the same)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Attempt2:&lt;br&gt;
Disabled MF MPEG-4 File Handler Using ShellExView.&lt;br&gt;
Regular key deletion and recreation using regedit.&lt;br&gt;
Unsuccessful (Handler remains the same)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Attempt3:&lt;br&gt;
Deleted Entire CLSID {f81b1b56-7613-4ee4-bc05-1fab5de5c07e}.&lt;br&gt;
Regular key deletion and recreation using regedit.&lt;br&gt;
MF MPEG-4 Property Handler disappears from ShellExView.&lt;br&gt;
FIleMeta association manager no longer displays MF MPEG-4 Property Handler for the .mp4 format it instead displays the .dll (mfmp4srcsnk.dll) as the handler.&lt;br&gt;
Unsuccessful (Handler name changes, file manager options unavailable)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Attempt4:&lt;br&gt;
Deleted Entire CLSID {f81b1b56-7613-4ee4-bc05-1fab5de5c07e}.&lt;br&gt;
Deleted the .dll (mfmp4srcsnk.dll)&lt;br&gt;
MF MPEG-4 Property Handler disappears from ShellExView.&lt;br&gt;
Regular key deletion and recreation using regedit.&lt;br&gt;
FIleMeta association manager no longer displays MF MPEG-4 Property Handler for the .mp4 format it instead displays nothing as the handler.&lt;br&gt;
Unsuccessful (Handler name changes, file manager options still unavailable)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1:30am:&lt;br&gt;
aaaaaaaaand that's where my heads at right now.&lt;br&gt;
Either way I have to get back finishing assignments as the crash caused a few to become overdue.
&lt;br&gt;
Hopefully someone has a clue whats going on here and I can get my organization scheme back.
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks anyone and everyone! :)&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;To manually remove the property handler for a file type, e.g., .mp4:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start regedit as administrator.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PropertySystem\PropertyHandlers.mp4, backup that key, then remove that key.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PropertySystem\SystemPropertyHandlers, backup that key, find the entry for “.mp4” and remove that entry.
&lt;br&gt;
Note: If you get an access denied error on the previous step, right-click on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PropertySystem\SystemPropertyHandlers, click on Permissions…, Advanced, and change the Owner to the Administrators group.
 Then assign full access to the Administrators group in the same dialog and retry.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then use the filemeta association manager to set the filemeta property handler for .mp4 file type.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
As always, be careful when using the registry editor, and make sure you backup the settings before changing them.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi ShedoSurashu &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have tested File Meta on Windows 10 and it has worked as expected. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Are you getting any errors during installation? Note also that the context menu will not show up anywhere until you use the File Association Manager (added to the start menu under File Metadata) to configure one or more extensions to use the File Meta property
 handler, and then it will show up only on files with those extensions. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;You’re quite right. The reason is that .gif already has a property handler, and so File Meta leaves it alone. You need to choose an extension that does not have a property handler, and add the File Meta property handler to it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The logic behind this restriction is that a given extension can have only one property handler, so if I overrode the setting for .gif, for example, you would lose all the capabilities of the Windows-provided property handler. Unfortunately, there is no additive
 mechanism that would allow me to keep the built-in capabilities, but add additional metadata properties.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you are really determined to replace the Windows property handler, it can be done with a registry tweak, but this should only be done with a full awareness of the consequences.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Ah that sucks, the main reason I got File Metadata is so I can tag my collection of reaction GIFs. I'll have to think about if I want to go ahead with replacing the Windows-provided handler but would you please tell how it can be done? So I have the knowledge
 at hand in case I decide to do it.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have extended the FileMeta property handler to work with a “down level” property handler. In other words, in the above example it can show the stock properties like “dimensions”, “width”, “height”, etc. from the stock .bmp property handler, and you’d still
 able to set other properties via FileMeta. I use this for .mpg and similar files, and it works great.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, at this time it must be configured via registry, as I had no time so far to update the FileMeta GUI to help configuring it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I can give you the patch to the property handler if you like, and describe how to configure it.
&lt;br&gt;

    <Discussion Title="Metadata and desktop.ini on network server">
      <Posts>
        <Post From="michaelb01" When="25/09/2015 10:33:11">
          <Html>
        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I'm trying to add some metadata to our system (Windows 7) at work. I actually couldn't get FileMeta to work properly but I understand that it doesn't work with folders anyway which is my main requirement.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I did however manage to customise folder using the desktop.ini file. With this I can customise the icon of the folder and also add a tooltip (which also appears in the "comments" details column). However, I can only seem to do this on local folders/files,
 so my main question is this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I create desktop.ini and customise folders on a network server (or is called network share?)?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Every time I try to do this the desktop.ini file disappears and Windows tells me that the it "could not find this item".. I've tried doing this using python instead which again works locally but I get an IOerror if I try to do it on the network. So
 I assume it's a permission thing??&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any other way of adding metadata to folders?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
The wishlist would be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;custom thumbnails (jpegs as well as .ico files) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'comments' column (windows explorer) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'authors' column (windows explorer) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'rating' column (windows explorer)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
And I would like to be able to edit this all via python.. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hopefully someone can tell me whats possible or if there are any workarounds.. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Cheers&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I would also very much like to be able to add metadata to folders. I’ve never regarded default.ini as a very satisfactory approach, and with your reports of its failure to work on a server, it seems even less of a good way forward.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As mentioned in previous discussions, it turns out that NTFS supports the addition of alternate streams to folders as well as files, and the use of the same APIs to write general metadata properties to them that File Meta uses for files. The problem is that
 I have not been able to find any extensions to Windows Explorer that will display this metadata as it does for files, let alone edit it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, at the moment, the only way forward that I can see for folder metadata is to use some other UI to display and edit it - but I am really reluctant to go there. For me, doing everything in Windows Explorer is a huge win.

&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for your reply. Do you have any ideas why the desktop.ini file might not work on a server? Maybe because its a system file and I don't have permissions to view that??
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It seems other than that there aren't any good alternatives.. I'd be very interested to know if you crack it though!&lt;br&gt;

    <Discussion Title="Synchronisation of Alternate Data Streams">

        <Post From="benjsc" When="24/09/2015 05:49:43">
          <Html>
        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I have worked out how to use File Metadata as a basic document management tool. It works well on a single machine however in my case I would like to synchronise the files between remote computers over the internet. I think this may be applicable to many
 people these days using Dropbox and the like. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My research indicates Dropbox and similar will not preserve ADS on sync however it appears BitTorrent Sync can synchronise ADS. The catch is that the streams must be added to a 'white list' or they are ignored (I guess for security reasons).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have worked out how to identify the streams added by File Metadata using PowerShell. However, on testing, the stream name starts with Unicode character 'Black Club Suit' ♣, specifically ♣SummaryInformation. PowerShell (Get-content) does not seem
 to recognise this stream nor does BT Sync. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Assuming the ♣ is the issue is there a way to avoid using this character in the stream name? Alternatively, how can I add the name with ♣ effectively? Is there any guidance available in terms of how streams are named or could be controlled in File
 Metadata? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for the product and your assistance.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi benjsc, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
File Meta does not have any influence over what is stored in the alternate streams: they are entirely controlled by NTFS. Having said that, I believe that they are instances of OLE Document Storage, which is a complex binary format, and why you see names prefixed
 with strange characters. It may be possible to decode this format, but there is no way to change it. So any transport mechanism needs to transport the entire contents of the alternate stream unchanged, or NTFS will fail to decode it at the other end.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The only other way I have thought of to move the metadata around is to export it to XML, and reimport it at the other end; obviously, though this breaks the file copy metaphor that is what one really wants.

&lt;br&gt;
There is currently no way to do this. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, adding the capability to create custom profiles is high on my list of features for the next version. The idea would be to allow you to add any of the 600 or so built-in Windows properties to a custom profile (e.g. System.Message.FromName would be the
 appropriate property for 'from'), and then apply that profile to file types of your choice.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If I do this work over the next few weeks, would you be prepared to beta test it for me? This would be a great help in ensuring that I come up with something that is actually useful and usable.

Great work! I've searched for a tool like yours desperately! I'm so glad I've found this one!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I very much like to have the option of editing the whole standard property set - If you need a beta tester, just drop me a line!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
All the best&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I miss the possibility to mark multiple files and export them to metadata-filea with the same name but the extension ".metadata'. In the same way, you can do it for one file already via the context-menu in windows explorer.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I had envisaged the main scenario for this as being metadata backup/restore, for which I added a command line solution so that it could be done easily from batch files, and I could support the specification of a target folder.

I could certainly still add support to the context menu for selecting multiple files in Explorer, though. I will add it to the list of requests.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I've tested File Metadata on Win8.1 64-bit and it works!&lt;br&gt;
And another two feature still needed.&lt;br&gt;
1.&lt;br&gt;
My main file manager is TC(Total Commander) and I've used a plugin named ShellDetails to display all Windows Explorer's fields.&lt;br&gt;
However, I can NOT see the file's metadata which I've edited and saved in Windows Explorer, such fields include rating, categories and tags.&lt;br&gt;
2.&lt;br&gt;
Also, when I right click, choose properties and go to Details tab, the metadata appears there can NOT be edited.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For these files such as &lt;em&gt;.mp3 and &lt;/em&gt;.docx, their properties displays in TC columns and can be edited in Properties tab.&lt;br&gt;
It seems that TC can NOT read the metadata which is editing-enabled by File Metadata.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Please help to check this and enable metadata editing in TC.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi valuex &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have never looked at Total Commander, so I thought I would give it a go. I installed version 8.51a, 64-bit, on my 64-bit Windows 7 system. I then added version 1.24 of the ShellDetails plug-in. File Meta is configured to handle metadata for .txt files. I'm
 seeing the following: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1) Adding a custom column referring to the standard comments property: '[=tc.comment]' shows no values. However, referring to the ShellDetails comments property: ' [=shelldetails.Comments]' produces the desired result, Total Commander shows the comments added
 to a .txt file in Windows Explorer. Similarly, ' [=shelldetails.Tags]' shows the tags.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
2) Right clicking on a file in Total Commander shows exactly the same context menu as appears in Windows Explorer. The details pane shows, and allows the editing of, comment and tags properties for .txt files
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, at least on my system, things actually work pretty well. Are the problems you are seeing related to the extension you look at? Can you reproduce my successes with .txt files? Also, what do you see when you right click on a file in Windows Explorer? Does
 the details pane work there? &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi mmp997 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When you used the File Association Manager to configure the extensions you wanted metadata for, what profiles did you pick for the PDF and HTML extensions?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also, did you restart Explorer once you had configured these extensions? (as described in
&lt;a href="https://filemeta.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Getting%20Started&amp;amp;referringTitle=Home" rel="nofollow"&gt;
Getting Started&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For Word documents, the properties shown are determined by the Microsoft property handler installed with Office, which the File Association Manager will leave carefully alone.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Word is no problem, I don't have many Word docs I want to comment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For html, on setup I selected that your program should deal with it, i.e., I picked File Property Meta Handler. For pdf, I did not have this choice! I could not select it! It is dealt with by default by XChange PDF Property Handler.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I then restarted the PC. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have now uninstalled the PDF XChange PDF Program, restarted the PC, and re-ran the installation of File Metadata. I am now able to select pdfs (during installation I got the error message 'some errors occured during handler setup' but ignored it).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for prompting me to think!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I think that the PDF XChange folk are doing a pretty thorough job by installing a property handler to give you access to such fields as Title and Authors. The standard Adobe reader does not do this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately, they can't help with Comments, because the PDF format does not define anywhere to put them, rather surprisingly. Thus, comments can only be delivered by a solution that keeps metadata outside the file, like File Meta. So, as you say, the way
 forward is to remove PDF XChange, or at least its property handler, if that is a configuration option, and use File Meta instead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can tell whether a file extension has been set up successfully after an error by restarting the File Association Manager and seeing whether the extension you were trying to set up appears at the top of the list amongst those with the File Meta property
 handler configured. If not, it is okay to try again.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Yep. What I have found is that removing PDF XChange also removes the Preview function, there is extensive forum discussion of preview problems with the Windows Explorer / Adobe combination. So (for me) the cure is worse than the illness. I am moving the
 patient to another ward &lt;a href="http://www.pretentiousname.com/adobe_pdf_x64_fix/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://www.pretentiousname.com/adobe_pdf_x64_fix/index.html&lt;/a&gt; where the doctors have discovered a fix.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So both Preview and Comments work, and I am happy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But how to sort Comments alphabetically? By default, Zaphod Beeblebrox is on top of the column, when we want Adam to come first. Minor issue, however.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Great. I'm glad that you have got it all going at once. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On your minor issue: in Explorer, clicking on the 'Comments' header at the top of the column should reverse the sort order. That's not me, it works for all columns in Explorer.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi. Am I right that file metadata are not synced by programs such as Dropbox? I have installed a new PC with DropBox folders synced from my laptop, the Metadata don't show up.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I haven't tried Dropbox in particular, but in general, moving a file outside NTFS will lose metadata added by File Meta, so I strongly suspect that you are right.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The workaround is to use the &lt;a href="https://filemeta.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Command%20Line%20Support&amp;amp;referringTitle=Documentation" rel="nofollow"&gt;
command line utility&lt;/a&gt; to export the metadata to XML files, which you can move using Dropbox, and then the command line utility again to reimport them and apply them to the files on your new PC.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Duh, I just looked at the documentation tab !! Skip this discussion. Sorry.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I want to write a script that will pickup "words" (pattern based) from filenames and parent/grandparent directories and add them as tags. So, please tell me how to use command line to add tags to a file. Then, I could build a script around that command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Secondly, .. This application is awesome !! This should be part of the next Windows release. People from other OSes will adapt and include this tag system in their OSes so that tags don't disappear on switching OSes, when, they'll see how good this NTFS tags
 are.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Gaurav &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yes, my command line utility does not provide access to properties from a script.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But Microsoft provides DSOFile here: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;amp;id=8422" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;amp;id=8422&lt;/a&gt;, and describes it here:
&lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee692828.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee692828.aspx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In fact, in my test suite for File Metadata, included in my Sources download, I use a script to round trip more than 600 different writable Windows metadata properties through DSOFile and File Metadata, to make sure that this scenario works correctly.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello everyone, newbie here.&lt;br&gt;
I'd like to say thank you to the author for a good program which re-adds a very useful functionality, at least for me.
&lt;br&gt;
Why Microsoft canceled it since Vista onward is beyond me.&lt;br&gt;
Now for a small bug.&lt;br&gt;
I have a machine with Windows Vista and service pack 1.&lt;br&gt;
About .mpg files, I noticed a incompatibility with Filemeta 1.2 and Mediainfo ver. 0.7.69.0.
&lt;br&gt;
If the latter is activated, Filemeta shows the metadata fields empty and gives a error when trying to save any info
&lt;br&gt;
in the fields. The error is the very generic "0x80004005".&lt;br&gt;
When Mediainfo is deactivated, Filemeta works as expected: shows the files correctly and saves any modification.
&lt;br&gt;
It shows the metadata written in windows XP, too.&lt;br&gt;
About AVI files, Filemeta works without problems with abcAVI Tag editor 1.8.0.115&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I had a look at MediaInfo, down to some of the source code, and it all looks innocent enough.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When you say 'activated', do you mean: MediaInfo window open, showing information for a file? And, if so, does the problem with displaying and editing metadata with File Meta apply to just the file that MediaInfo is displaying, or all .mpg files?
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello Dijji&lt;br&gt;
and thanks for the quick response.&lt;br&gt;
When I say "activated", I mean Mediainfo set (in its program) to display the infos. Usually I don't even open the program window,
&lt;br&gt;
it simply works in background to provides informations, when I hoover the mouse cursor on a file name.&lt;br&gt;
And it works, but it seems to "block" Filemeta and I can't see any metatag, either in explorer windows or&lt;br&gt;
in the properties windows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Milkyway70 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To answer your second question first, Windows does have to have heard of an extension for it to appear in File Association Manager. Happily, however, all it takes to register a completely new extension is a single empty registry key for the extension under
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. So, for .mkv, you would add:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.mkv]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
The next time you open File Association Manager, the .mkv extension should appear.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Returning to the original question of MediaInfo, all I can think is that MediaInfo is holding the files open, preventing File Metadata from opening them and reading the metadata properties. I'm not very convinced by this explanation. It might be possible to
 investigate further, by looking at what else is blocked, e.g. file editing, or whether hovering over a file in one Explorer window affects the display of metadata in another Explorer window showing the same file.
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Your software is really very useful for us. Thanks for your work. And I think tag for folder will be an enhance to this software. I am not familiar with ntfs ads. But I know that we can add ads stream to any folder or files in command line like:&lt;br&gt;
echo tag1 &amp;gt; tagtestfolder:Comment &lt;br&gt;
and you can see the Comment info like: &lt;br&gt;
more &amp;lt; tagtestfolder:Comment &lt;br&gt;
Now I use &lt;a href="http://www.ghisler.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;total commander&lt;/a&gt; with a ntfs plugin
&lt;a href="http://www.totalcmd.net/plugring/NTFS_diz.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;NTFS_diz&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe the idea of this plugin can help you to enhance this nice software.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thank you whhfly2003, that is very useful. I hadn't realised that alternate streams would work with folders on NTFS in the same way that they do with files. Of course, that opens up the possibility of storing arbitrary metadata on folders. Way better than
 desktop.ini!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now I need to try and figure out the most natural way possible of making that metadata readable and editable in Explorer.

Thanks again &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I wonder if anyone can help? &lt;br&gt;
My data files are stored on a Windows 7 machine (64), when I use an XP machine across the network I can see contents of the metadata fields. Having downloaded and installed "File metadata" and associated the file extension, I see the fields available
 at the bottom of the screen but they don't contain the data I was seeing (and can still see) from the XP machine. Now there's a very good chance I'm being an idiot here and very happy for anyone to point that out to me, particularly if it means I start to
 see that lovely Metadata(sad I know).&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi sewfan99 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
File Meta stores metadata in a property store provided by NTFS and held in an annex to a file. This is not where XP stored its metadata, and accordingly, File Meta will not read metadata created with XP, typically using Explorer.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, you are not the first person to wish that it did. I will investigate whether at least some form of import is possible. I don't know what the storage mechanism in XP was, but it worked with files held on FAT drives, and certainly had no dependency on
 NTFS. Time for a delve into the archives! &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I see, I think. In my car the data was stored via an application called wilcom es which is a commercial embroidery package. I can still store when running the application on the windows 7 machine and view from the XP machine. Thanks for responding

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;No problem. In fact, what you say raises a very interesting possibility. It seems that, owing to the magic of backwards compatibility, whatever the XP mechanism is, it still works on Windows 7. So, if I can figure out how to access it, I should be able
 to open up a whole new set of capabilities for people with XP still in their lives. There may be a whole bunch of people at some future point who are very grateful that you asked your question.

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Well that's very pleasing, although in my case I want to be able to see the metadata on another windows 7 machine across the network, the originating application being constrained to one machine via a dongle.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Well, it looks like I was almost completely wrong. Apparently, XP would store metadata only for files on NTFS, and it used the same mechanism as File Meta. I've just used XP Explorer to set Subject and Comment metadata on a .txt file, copied the file to
 a Windows 7 system with File Meta installed and the property handler setup for .txt, and, lo and behold, the metadata shows up in Explorer there too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To be clear, in XP I set the metadata using the Summary tab you see when you right click on the file in Explorer and choose Properties. How are you looking at your metadata?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi sewfan99 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As you may have gathered, I've been surprised to discover how XP handled metadata. To be clear, by metadata I mean properties like: Subject, Title, and Comment, as seen in the Summary tab of the properties dialog box in Explorer.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It seems that XP stored these metadata properties in one of two places. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For files of certain known extension types, the properties were stored in the file itself. Thus, the properties are always transferred with the file, and are available whether the file is held on a FAT or NTFS drive. For XP out of the box, the known extensions
 are: .bmp, .db, .gif, .ico, .jfif, ,jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .rle , .tif, tiff, .url, and .wdp. Installing Office would doubtless add such extensions as .doc and .xls to the list. On Windows 7, properties for files with these types would only be visible where
 Windows 7 has knowledge of the appropriate file format, which, in most of the cases listed, it does.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For files with other extension types, XP stored the properties in alternate streams attached to the files. This mechanism is provided by and only available with NTFS, and is the same mechanism used by File Meta. Because of the dependency on NTFS, the Summary
 tab is only shown if the file is on an NTFS drive, and the metadata is lost if the file is moved to a FAT drive. In Windows 7, properties for these types would not be visible out-of-the-box. File Meta, however, should enable these property values to be seen.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, to return to your case, I'm guessing that the embroidery program stores its data in a file with an extension that is not in the above list. You say, also, that the metadata is visible on machines where the program is not installed. I'm guessing that you
 are using Explorer to look at this metadata, and that it appears in the Summary tab. If all this is true, then the metadata should also be visible on a Windows 7 system with File Meta installed and the property handler set up for the file extension used by
 the embroidery program. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, it seems that this is not the case. Are my assumptions incorrect? If not, one diagnostic is to use the metadata context menu installed by File Meta in Explorer to export the metadata associated with one of your files to XML. What do you see? Could
 you paste the contents into this thread? &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;Yes the file extension in my case is .emb. Yes I'm using explorer on an XP machine to see the metadata of files stored on a Windows 7 machine across the network. On that Windows 7 I have installed File Meta, and have
 associated the property handler for file extension type .emb . So yes your assumptions are correct with the possible chance that I've been an idiot somewhere along the line, and I'm going to take some time this morning (with a fresh brain) to just recheck
 everything. I will try to follow your suggestions and export the metadata.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font-family: verdana,sans-serif;"&gt;I really appreciate your interest in my problem, I'm trying to see if I can set up a production workshop windows 8 tablet to interrogate the Metadata since it holds design information for our embroidery designs. I
 may have mentioned that the application we use is constrained by dongle so I can't actually run a second copy on the tablet.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Sure. If you right click on an .emb file in Explorer, you should see a Metadata entry in the menu that comes up. If you expand that menu, you should be given the option to Export the metadata to an XML file. You can see the contents of the file by opening
 it in, say, Notepad. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Having delved into how XP handled metadata, there is another explanation that fits all the facts.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
XP had built-in support for OLE Compound Documents, which was a mechanism for storing data files with complex internal structure that Microsoft was encouraging all application writers to use wherever appropriate. XP shows metadata from these documents whether
 or not the application is installed, but Vista and later do not. &lt;br&gt;
In this &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/benkaras/archive/2007/01/21/what-do-property-handlers-accomplish.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;
blog post&lt;/a&gt; (in the comments), a Vista user is complaining about this, and the Microsoft developer recommends a solution. The answer is to add the following entries to the registry:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PropertySystem\PropertyHandlers\.emb]
@="{97e467b4-98c6-4f19-9588-161b7773d6f6}"
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.emb]
"FullDetails"="prop:System.PropGroup.Description;System.Title;System.Subject;System.Keywords;System.Category;System.Comment;System.Rating;System.PropGroup.Origin;System.Author;System.Document.RevisionNumber"
"PreviewDetails"="prop:System.Title;System.Subject;System.Keywords;System.Category;System.Comment;System.Rating;System.Author;System.Document.RevisionNumber"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
if you copy the above lines and paste them into a new Notepad document, then save them as a file with the extension .reg, you will have a file which, when double clicked in Explorer, will add these entries to your registry. If the .emb file is an OLE Compound
 Document, then these entries should cause metadata to appear in Explorer on Vista and later (you may have to log off and log on first)&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I've been looking for this for a really long time now and had only found third party software that handled tagging on their own so far... Your program seems to be exactly what I had been looking for!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I had no problem adding File Meta Handler to the .txt extension for example and it did what I wanted (more specifically enabled tags). However, I was looking for a way to enable tags for some file types that appear at the top of the list in the File Meta Association
 Manager. FLV, for example, which are shown to already have a handler and won't let me click Add File Meta Handler.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Is there a way to make this possible? I might just not understand your program very well... If you'd care to explain to me why it is or it is not possible?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Tomatoshadow &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yes, it is certainly possible. However, it is important to understand what is going on, so as not to leave yourself worse off than you started.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When Windows Explorer reads and writes metadata, it does so using a Property Handler registered for the file’s extension. As you have observed, File Meta Association Manager will only allow you to specify its own Property Handler if there is none already registered
 for an extension. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Take .flv as an example, which I believe is Flash Video. My machine has no Property Handler registered for this extension, but yours evidently does. So the question arises, what put it there? Also, what are its capabilities?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If the Property Handler can read and write tag properties, as can the Property Handler for.jpg installed by Windows, then you are done. If it cannot, then we can remove it, but then what functionality would we lose? Presumably, whatever installation put it
 there, put it there for a purpose. Unfortunately, there is no way to 'chain' Property Handlers: there can only be one for a given file extension.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Assume for a moment that we know what the installed Property Handler does, and we are happy to dispense with its services. How do we replace it? The cleanest way is to uninstall the software that set up the Property Handler, but of course we then lose the other
 capabilities of that software. The alternative is to edit the registry to remove the Property Handler from the extension, so that the File Meta Association Manager will be happy to set up its own. But of course, this leaves the installation of the software
 whose Property Handler we overrode in an odd state. What would happen if we subsequently uninstalled it? It would depend on exactly which installation technology it used, but the results are not, in general, predictable.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, that is the territory. It should be clear why I was careful to ensure that File Meta Association Manager would not override existing Property Handler registrations: you have to know what you're doing, and it leads into murky places.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you want to go that way, I can give you guidance about the registry edits required, but I think a better question would be, do you need the software that has installed the conflicting Property Handler, or is there some other software that provides a Property
 Handler with metadata capabilities? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for the quick and very helpful response! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I understand, thanks for confirming what I thought! Flv is Flash Video indeed. I have K-Lite codec install which makes Windows Media Player able to read Flvs and allows Explorer to show a thumbnail for Flvs! I'm assuming that's why.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I would also assume that by removing any association with the current property handler, I would lose my playback support and definitely lose my thumbnails...
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I do not know of some codec pack that adds metadata capabilities to most video files but that sounds like something possible... Not something I would be able to do myself though!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think the easiest way to solve my problem would be to re encode my videos in h.264 (mp4). Not only is that a very efficient format and might help me save some space but that format handles metadata natively from what I've seen.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
...Problem is, I literally have over a thousand videos. Some of them are mp4 and wmv which handle metadata but most are FLVs, some avi and little 3gp too. It would take an extremely long time to re-encode a thousand FLVs into mp4, even though my machine is
 quite powerful (Overclocked Haswell i7). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm wondering what would be the best solution for me. Thank you for your help! I love what you're doing, I was tired of finding nothing but third party software and unhelpful people saying it was impossible to tag anything else than jpegs. Your program might
 not be what I was looking for but I'll definitely remember it if I need it! &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I think your analysis is spot-on. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The only alternative approach that I can think of is to use VLC media player, &lt;a href="http://www.videolan.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://www.videolan.org/&lt;/a&gt;, which is the pick of the open source solutions, and commendably omnivorous. It comes with its own codecs, which would allow you to uninstall K-Lite and free up the Property Handler registration slot. The drawback is that you would
 lose the thumbnails, which I assume are the reason that K-Lite installs a Property Handler in the first place.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sorry, I can't think of any approaches that give you the best of all worlds. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hey! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I already use VLC media player, I'm aware that it comes with its own codecs but I usually have k-lite installed anyway... Considering I use K-lite most of the time now, I'd only have to uninstall it but having thumbnails for every type of video files is very,
 very useful for me, so even if just for that I'd keep it... I'm not sure there is any other solutions to have thumbnails that don't involve having a handler for those files.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My solution right now, although it may not be optimal, is to re-encode all my videos in mp4. While it may sound like a lot of trouble, I was very relieved to see that Handbrake handles batch encoding.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If anyone is wondering, you can simply select a folder and open it as the source in Handbrake, it will go through every single video files in it which you can then all add to the batch queue. I set things up so that they keep their original name and case and
 are saved as mp4 in a "re-encoded" folder. The default settings usually keep the same FPS and similar bitrate so the file size will either be the same, slightly bigger or much smaller (especially when going from badly encoded files or wmv files).
 Then I only have to press "Start" and it will go through all files one by one, you can even set it up to shut down your computer once it's done.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So yesterday, I was able to re-encode a whole subfolder of around 100 videos in about 10 minutes. Then simply select all the re-encoded files and tag them all with the folder name (which was used as the category I wanted to make a tag).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I wish I could have kept the files as they were and use your program but batch encoding them is not as much of a bother as it seemed. Plus, I'll save tons of space in the long run... I also had a couple of corrupted avis that could only be played with VLC etc...
 A bit of a hassle but worth it in the end, I guess! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm sure I'll find some other use for your program though, tagging is a functionality I never took advantage of in windows and really should have! Thanks for your help :)&lt;br&gt;

I just found this site and your program, and this is great! I would really like to be able to tag all of my images, but my Win7 x64 system already has "IPropertyStore Handler for Images". That applies to bmp, gif, ico, jpg, jpeg, png, tif, etc. The
 jpg and tif extensions already have the ability to add tags, but the others do not. I am comfortable making changes in the registry, provided you would walk me through exactly what and where. I already have a full backup of my registry.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi shadow98cat &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
OK, here we go. I will use .bmp as an example. The registry setting that specifies "IPropertyStore Handler for Images” as the property handler for .bmp is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PropertySystem\PropertyHandlers\.bmp] 
@="{a38b883c-1682-497e-97b0-0a3a9e801682}"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
The steps to take are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup the current registry settings, either per extension, as above, or perhaps specifying the PropertyHandlers key to backup the settings for all extensions.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delete the key for the extension, in this case .bmp, under PropertyHandlers &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use the File Meta Association Manager to apply the File Meta Property Handler to the extension (at this point, the registry key you just deleted will be back, but with a different value).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kill all instances of explorer.exe and restart it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
To restore the original state, use File Meta Association Manager to remove the File Meta Property Handler, and then reapply the backed up registry settings.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note that this replaces the Windows Property Handler completely. Any capabilities that it provides, such as displaying thumbnails, will be lost.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello Dijji, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That worked just the way I was hoping it would, thank you. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Windows is still showing thumbnail / icon previews, and is giving me the opportunity to add extra details like tags. Based on your description, I'm not sure why
 the preview images are still showing. I would like to know that this is reliably reproducible (enhanced metadata and preview images), so if there's any other information I can give you on my configuration please let me know.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One other brief issue that the registry information you provided was helpful in fixing. The extension .chm was not already assigned on my computer, so I attempted to add it in the file association manager. As soon as I click to add that type, the program gave
 me a not responding error, then crashed completely. After re-opening the program it functions normally except for that extension shows that it was assigned the handler. But when I right click a .chm file in Windows, I'm not seeing the extra fields in the properties
 that should be there. In the file association manager, if I try to click on the .chm extension to remove the handler, the program crashes. The fix I found was deleting the .chm registry key in the location you specified. Just an FYI, I don't know what it is
 about .chm, but maybe something worth looking into. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I'm sorry about the delayed response, I've just been going through the Discussions, and found that I missed this one.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Icon and Preview handlers are separately registered Explorer extensions, so I guess it does make sense that they will carry on working, even after the property handler has been removed. This should be repeatable on other systems.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On the crash, it turns out that the registry entries for .chm (and a few other help related extensions) have special permissions set that do not allow Administrator write access. A bug in the File Association Manager caused it to crash when its attempts to
 update the entry failed. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This has been fixed in version 1.2, producing a sensible error message instead. If you ever did want to add metadata to a .chm file you would have to go in and change the permissions on the registry key, though you might have to write a program to do it, as
 you would need to be running as System! &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The Association Manager display has a built-in confusion. The extensions with extant system-provided Handlers show Metadata properties as being editable, when they are in fact
&lt;strong&gt;not editable&lt;/strong&gt;, as show highlighted in this image.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi DAV4IS &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You're right. If there are programmers that can create good UI, and programmers that can't, I'm definitely one of the former.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The metadata properties shown in fact relate purely to the currently selected profile. When the selected extension has a handler other than the File Meta property handler, this has no meaning.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Any suggestions as to how I can improve this would be gratefully received. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I could adopt the same approach that I have with the Add Handler and Remove Handler buttons, which are enabled only when all of the selected extensions can be acted on. The result would be something like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All selected extensions have no handler: profile combo box is enabled and profile property lists are shown.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All selected extensions have File Meta handler: profile combo box is disabled and profile for the first selected extension is shown in combo box and profile property lists.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All other cases: profile combo box is disabled and profile property lists are empty.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
What do you think? &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
This will be clearer when File Meta 1.2 becomes the recommended release, shortly.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For File Meta 1.1, the command line support is available as a separate beta download. For File Meta 1.2, command line support is part of the standard package. In both cases, filemeta.exe is installed in the program files folder File Metadata, though the beta
 was x86 only. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hope this helps. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thanks for the reply. I just installed version 1.2 and everything seems to work as intended.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'd just like to mention a couple things that caused me some confusion that might be useful to include in a FAQ or Troubleshooting doc.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First, when using FileMeta with Microsoft's Windows Explorer, the metadata is handled exactly as documented and it allows you to do some nice things like sorting a list of files by Title or Tags. However, none of the 3rd party file managers I tried handles
 the metadata properly. So, I was under the impression that FileMeta wasn't working right, but it was just the file manager I was using. Like many people, I don't really care much for Windows Explorer. Are you aware of any free file manager that enables the
 use of metadata for all file types? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Second, the text editor I use blows away the metadata when saving a file. I did see that this is documented. I'll try changing the editor settings to update the file inplace.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When there is a hardlinked file, you don't see the metadata for the file it's linked to and you get an error if you try to add metadata. It would be great if the metadata could be shared somehow. But, if that can't be done, it might be advisable to document
 the limitation. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You'd think that with all the money Bill Gates has, he'd be able to hire somebody to make metadata work for all file types. But, I digress. Thanks for a great product.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi ronco,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I do not know of any such third party File Manager. However, this is not saying very much since I have very little experience with alternatives to Explorer. It is a shame if alternative File Managers do not exploit the property system: it defines more than
 2600 properties and their associated metadata, and makes them all accessible through a reasonably straightforward API. Though, of course, how most of these properties are stored is not defined by out-of-the-box Windows for most file types, hence File Meta.
 If I discover (or anybody can point out) a third-party File Manager that does respect properties, I will mention it in the documentation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On the links, I'm not experiencing the same problems as you are. On my Windows 7 system, Windows Explorer shows and allows the editing of metadata properties for both hard links and symbolic links (to avoid any ambiguity, I mean the links created using mklink,
 and you do have to give the link a name with the same extension as the linked file to make it work). Changes are reflected, as you would expect, both on the original file and other links to the file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm glad that you're finding my efforts useful!&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I tried the link again. I associated .txt and .htm to the Simple profile. I linked source.txt to target.txt and the metadata was shared. I removed source.txt and target.txt. I created source.txt and linked it to target.htm. The metadata did not share to
 target.htm. And an error occurred when I tried adding metadata to target.htm. So, it seems to be a problem only when the extension is different.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I used the Windows port of the Linux ln command to do the links (ln -T source target). It's part of the coreutils for Windows package. I think it works the same as mklink but I'm not sure of that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I see that you mentioned that the extension has to be the same for it to function properly. Is there any chance this limitation could be worked around as long as the profile of editable properties is the same?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Intriguing. I took a target .txt file, and created a link to it with a.pdf extension (.txt and.pdf are both set up to use the File Meta property handler), and metadata read and write work correctly. A link with a .txt extension to a .pdf file also works
 fine. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Profile does not seem to matter. In these tests, .txt, was configured with the simple profile and .pdf the Office profile. I was able to update even properties on the .txt file that are not in the simple profile (e.g. content type) using a .pdf link without
 a problem. This is not surprising, as the profile controls what properties Explorer displays, but is not referenced at any deeper level.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The only thing that seems to be important is that the extensions of the source and target are both set up to use the File Meta property handler.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I wonder if this is about using mklink? Could you give that a try?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I did try mklink, and the link between .txt and .htm is working as expected now. The only little glitch is that Windows Explorer doesn't show all the same metadata for .txt and .htm.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I changed my text editor preferences so that it updates inplace when saving. And the metadata still disappears. I tired a simpler experiment.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
echo xyz &amp;gt;&amp;gt;file.txt &amp;lt;== append to the file and the metadata is preserved
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
echo xyz &amp;gt;file.txt &amp;lt;== overwrite the file and the metadata is gone &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I am glad that mklink addresses your issues with links. As far as I know, which properties are shown in Explorer is controlled entirely by the profile chosen for the extension, so to show the same properties for .txt and .htm, they should have the same
 profile. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The issue of loss of metadata when a file is edited is an important limitation of File Meta. And, as your editor and echo test demonstrate, it is not always easy to predict which actions are updates, and therefore metadata preserving, and which recreate the
 file, and therefore lose metadata. The only defence that I know of is to backup the metadata to XML, either for each file, or in bulk using the command line utility.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi currently using Windows 7 and installed the x64 edition of file meta association manager.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I want to enable all possible extensions, how do I do it? Hitting ctl + A highlights everything; however if I select .doc and hit ctl + A, I can't add Meta handler (grey out and shows "Office Document Property Handler"). If I select .dll, .fon, .exe
 or other system related with no handler, it is still grey out. I did love to edit notes to .exe files if possible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If I go to the bottom of the list and select say, .xlm and hit ctl + A, only .xlm has the "File Meta Property Handler" bold and not other files. Is there a easy one click handler for all possible extensions?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since you mentioned folders (not possible unless through .ini modification, at least for now) in the previous post and moving files to different system/drives loses meta data as it is not embedded to the file, is there a easier and faster way to just export
 all the meta data being copied/moved to than manually click one by one? especially if I want to copy/move 1000 files to a different drive/system or multiple folders of 23950 files? I tested out multiple highlighting files and the meta handler doesn't show
 up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Would have solved a lot of issues if these notes/meta can be stored as part of said file/folder, attached like a header/footer like filenotes used to do in XP so the notes never gets lost unless file is deleted or comments removed. But guess it isn't possible
 with newer Windows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Last but not least, what is the difference between simple and office DOS file in editable properties?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;No, there is currently no easy way to add handlers for all available extensions. This is a limitation of my code: it does not currently pick up multiple selections in the list of extensions, so even if you select multiple extensions, a handler will only
 be added for one of them. I think that I should remove this limitation, and will add a work item to include it in a future release.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yes, there is a better way to export metadata for multiple files. I have created a command line program for this very purpose, that can be used directly, or in batch files or scripts. It is currently available as a beta from the downloads page.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The difference between the two profiles is simply the number of properties that are made available. As you switch between the profiles on the left in the File Association Manager, you will see the lists of properties on the right change, showing which properties
 are included in each profile. The Office DSO Profile reflects the set of properties supported by an Office-released utility to manipulate Office file properties.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Sorry, missed that one. The answer is, that they do have property handlers, which is why they're grayed out, but the property handlers do not have names, so they show as blank. The property handler for .exe, for instance, turns out to be %SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I have now looked a little deeper into the question of multiple selection, and it raises some tricky issues:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selecting a handler displays its profile. What should be displayed when multiple handlers with different profiles are selected?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Add Handler and Remove Handler buttons are enabled and disabled based on the currently selected handler, and whether they are currently valid. What should happen when multiple handlers are selected, and, say, handlers can be added to some of them, but
 not others?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
My inclination now is to leave the current interface alone. It might be slow in some cases, but it is clear.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, I think that I should ensure that the description text for a greyed handler is never blank, so that confusion over whether there is a handler or not never arises.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;That would be easy to both questions. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If said profiles already have handlers, then it can simply display a grey out property as in no selection highlighted or no user input-able.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your concern regarding able to add to some and not others in handler is also easily solved by:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   all non handlers will be handled by FileMetaData, and not touch anything else with a handler.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a different note, the ability to search via handled by said handler would be great.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   Say .docx is handled by MS office and a search function for the extension, as in I want to modify .txt, I can easily type txt or .txt and the handler would be highlighted.  Much easier than scrolling down and searching for the extension one knows needed change or to see what the handler is.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As you mentioned in the previous post, regarding an extension with a handler already; you can possibly make it easier by:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;          one click on the handler to select backup and replace it with FileMetaData and a rollback option - with a description what the user is getting into.  The user clicks on the select-able dial to enable this option.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And yes, if a handler is being handled by another should never be blank so no confusion would exist :)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;OK, I have now implemented support for multiple selection and text search within the list of extensions.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These work as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If multiple extensions are selected, then Add Handler is enabled only if none of the extensions already have a handler, and Remove Handler is enabled only if all of the extensions have the File Meta Property Handler.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The profile shown is changed only when the first extension with a File Meta Property Handler is added to the current selection. I didn't go with greying out in the end, because it wasn't very clear when to un-grey.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can search the list of extensions by typing, say, ‘.txt’. It does not work if you just type ‘txt’.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
I have not implemented any support for overwriting existing property handlers. This should really not be done except by the knowledgeable, so preparedness to hack the registry to do this feels like a reasonable price of entry, especially given that I have specified
 the edits required. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These changes should be included in the next Release Candidate for version 1.2. &lt;br&gt;

Also, if there is a way to update information as in "ProgramVersion1.2.exe" and the author released "ProgramVersion2.01.exe" I like to delete "ProgramVersion1.2.exe" and retain "ProgramVersion2.01.exe" by transfering

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Xikul&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I need to add some more examples to the documentation. But for now…. if you open a command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your files, then this should do what you want (you may have to correct the path to filemeta.exe):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;"c:\Program Files\File Metadata\FileMeta.exe" -e -f="@ xml" *.*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Files with extensions not set up with File Meta will generate empty XML files. Also, the target folder must already exist, so if it doesn't, create it first:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;md "@ xml"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
For repeated use, you can create a cmd file containing these lines. You may also want to put "c:\Program Files\File Metadata" on the path for command prompts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do let me know if you have any problems.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

1) From above command prompt, I like to only export file types that containing their metadata (mean "&lt;strong&gt;not containing empty XML files&lt;/strong&gt;").
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
2) How to know "which specific files that containing their metadata either or not?" (Ex: I have 1000 files with extensions set up with File Meta, I've had to add "Authors, Tags, Subjects, Comments..." to 600 files, but I can't remember that

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I agree, this is a good idea. It will make it consistent with the context menu, when you can't import or export metadata for a file extension not using the File Meta property handler. It will make the most significant difference in the
&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; case, however, leading simply to errors in cases where inappropriate extensions are specified. I will add a work item.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm afraid I haven't been able to understand what you are looking for here. Is it an overview of which files are marked with which metadata? One could imagine a spreadsheet with the files as rows, the columns as properties, and the cells as property values.
 Is that the sort of thing you mean?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I suppose the answer is no, but is there a way to register property handlers globally, and not per file type? Something akin to * or AllFileSystemObjects.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi sxin &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You're right, my understanding of the property system is that there is no way to register a property handler for all file types. This makes sense when you consider that Microsoft eventually went with a design that required a property handler to understand the
 format of the files whose extension, or extensions, it handled. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I will soon be able to offer some help, however. I have been testing a version of the File Association Manager that supports selecting multiple extensions, so that you can add or remove the File Meta property handler to or from many file extensions at once.
 I plan to release this as part of a new release candidate for File Meta 1.2 within the next few weeks. I will repost on this discussion when I do so, so that you are notified.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thanks Dijji. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft's shortsightedness is unfortunate. Instead of a simple and clean solution, you have to litter the registry, and to keep updating it continuously with new filetypes. At least the idea of concentrating the property handlers config in its own subtree,
 instead of adding more junk directly to the file classes, was a smart move. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One thing I thought of was that even if there's no Microsoft support for multiple handlers, it should be possible to chain them "manually" by keeping in the registry a list of the old handler(s), then loading them manually and calling the needed interfaces
 directly. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I still dream of a good full replacement for Windows Explorer that will override it in the shell, but considering I'm yet to even find a satisfactory standalone file manager, chances are currently slim.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Support for selecting multiple extensions has now been released as part of File Meta 1.2, which is available from the Downloads page.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The chaining capability is an interesting idea. Suppose, however, that you chained one of the built-in property handlers with File Meta. Presumably, properties that could be written to the file format would be handled by the built-in property handler, while
 properties that the file format could not handle and therefore produced write errors would be written by File Meta. This leads to a situation in which properties are held in disjoint stores, and potentially to unexpected outcomes, e.g. if the file were e-mailed
 as an attachment, some properties would be preserved, and some would not. I'm not sure how this could be worked around.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hey Dijji,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for v1.2.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Emailing doesn't preserve ADSes also with FileMeta by itself, so it's not a big difference. But considering it's anyway a power-user feature, the sender or receiver will be aware of it. If they want to preserve that data they are likely to know what to do (RAR
 it up keeping ADSes, export/import, etc.).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My usage of FileMeta is just for file comments. I definitely don't want the comments to modify the file, even if a native handler supported that. My potential use of chaining would just be to view meta data of certain file formats (mostly media), which would
 otherwise require a 3rd party software.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Other people may have different goals, so a property handler chainer could have an option to control the handler precedence. And if custom properties are supported by Windows, another option could be to remap conflicting properties to something unique under
 a FileMeta group (assuming it's possible).&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My requirement is to view category and comments field of an existing .eml file. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I tried to enable File Meta Handler but there is already "Shell Message Handler" installed.
&lt;br&gt;
Even before thinking how to replace this with File Meta Handler, i wanted to test if installing it would solve my problem. So i went to windows explorer, right click on the column header and added categories and comments. and i see that these two columns are
 blank. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
i know that these columns have data because i am able to see it on File Properties &amp;gt; Summary Tab on windows 2003 server.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So my question is, suppose if i end up installing "File Meta Handler" for .eml files, will i be able to see category and comments from an existing eml files?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Belaku &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'm afraid that the answer is almost certainly not. This is about where comments and other properties are held. I think it is most likely that the comments you are seeing on 2003 server are held within the .eml files in a location specified by that format.
 File Meta does not know how to read any specific file format: it holds properties in a store defined by NTFS and held in an annex to a file, which is why it works with files that have no defined location for comments etc., e.g. .txt files.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To read comments from a particular file format, you need a property handler that understands that format. It looks like you have one on 2003 server, but not on the system that you are hoping to read the comments on. File Meta cannot help you with this, unfortunately.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Great piece of software, it's exactly what we're looking for. We need to be able to tag 3DS Max files and this does the job.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Problem is, when tagging files on a server, Windows won't recognise the tags via a search. It does, however, work perfectly via a local search.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Will this require an install on the server? I don't have the ability to do this myself, so hopefully there's a way around. If not, then I'll have to pester the server admin to install this on.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;I don't have the setup to reproduce your environment, but I will tell you what I can to try to help you to solve this.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are three key players: the indexing service in Windows Search; the property handler provided by File Meta; and the tagged file.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In a local search, all three pieces are on the same machine, and there is obviously no problem. When the files are on a server, there are two cases to consider: the indexing service could be running either locally, or on the server. I am pretty sure that, in
 either case, for the indexing service to pick up the File Meta tags, the property handler must be installed on the same machine.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, if the indexing service is running on the server, then File Meta will need be to be installed there too (though you can omit the optional part of the installation). But if the indexing service is running on a local machine with the files on a network share,
 and the indexing service can be persuaded to include the network share in its crawl, then File Meta would only need to be installed locally.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You can configure the local indexing service using Indexing Options in the Control Panel. I don't have a suitable setup to try this, but you may be able to persuade it to include the required network location, and thus avoid the need to install anything on
 the server. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do let me know how you get on. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;2 strikes unfortunately. Firstly we tried the indexing service, but there is no way to add network drives. Secondly, when we approached IT to get it installed on the servers, they declined. We're still unsure why, it shouldn't change the servers behaviour
 in anyway apart from allowing us to tag files. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Shame, because this would have made life easier for us. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If we get our way and they install the fix to the servers, I'll let you know how it goes.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I do have some sympathy with the position of the server people: after all, they are the ones who will get it in the neck when things go wrong.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I did have one thought that might help you to persuade them to help. It is possible to very considerably reduce the footprint of what needs to be installed on the servers, compared to running the standard setup. The following steps should give you indexing
 support with the least impact: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
a) Copy FileMetaPropertyHandler.dll (almost certainly the 64-bit version) to a suitable folder on the server.
&lt;br&gt;
b) Run, from an administrator prompt, the command “regsvr32 FileMetaPropertyHandler.dll”
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This gives you an installation consisting of one 17K DLL and some registry settings. The server guys should be able to check all the source code for this installation quite quickly, and can of course build it for themselves if they want to.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am the "server guy" in my office, and I would like to see this work on our office servers. Our user environment is mostly Windows 7, and the servers are 2008 R2. I didn't quite follow that last post, is that all that would be necessary for the server
 to "see" tags added to files on another machine that had the property handler added for a particular file type? I would have assumed that I would need to add the property handler for each file type on the server itself, but that is just a guess on
 my part. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The other question is, do you think I need to have indexing enabled on the server for the folders shared on the network? It currently is not, and I guess it's something I just hadn't given much thought to until now. I found
&lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/954822" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and it seems pretty straight forward. I don't want to change more than I have to on the server, but I do want to be able to add tags from my workstation, and then have them come up in
 a search. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also, I would like if possible to be able to add and edit tags from the server as well. But that would probably not be something I would do on a regular basis.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Yes, you're right, for the server to be able to see metadata properties on the files, the File Meta Property Handler will need to be to be registered for each extension.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for your second question, I'm afraid that I don't know. I've never done this myself, and I don't have access to an environment with a server, so I have no good means of finding out, either. If you do figure out the safest way to put this capability on your
 servers, it would be great if you could post back to this thread and share your insights. I will promote the material to a more visible location on the site.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for editing tags on the server, once the Property Handler is configured, it should be possible to do this using Explorer on the server. There is also a command line option, with a little more work.

&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for the quick response. I have successfully installed FileMeta(x64).msi on one of my servers (no errors). I was able to open the association manager and add the "Office DSO file" profile to several different extensions. After logging off
 the server and back on, tags I had added from my workstation and copied the files to the server, are showing on the server. I also tested adding more tags to my test txt file on the server, alternating adding from my workstation and from the server and it
 seems to work beautifully. So far, doing a tag search from my workstation of a server folder does not get me results of a file with that tag. I have yet to turn on indexing on the server, so that may be it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The one issue I noticed is from my workstation, when I right click on a file (on the server share) I've added tags to, at random I get this error message.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Image" src="http://i39.tinypic.com/250sh2t.png"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Then explorer crashes and restarts. I have repeated this several times, and it really seems to be at random (2 or 3 normal right clicks, then error). I was wondering if it might be related to
&lt;a href="https://filemeta.codeplex.com/workitem/9171" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; issue. I have also reproduced that right click explorer crash as well.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I well let you know when I try turning on the indexing. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thanks.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for the progress report, I will be very interested to hear about the final outcome.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On the error on right click, I think that is very likely to be the same issue, which will occur whenever the underlying file cannot be accessed for whatever reason (please see the comments I have added to the issue). I have a fix for the problem: with what
 urgency do you think I should release it? I will, in any case, give you access to a test version first, to verify that the problem has been fixed in your environment.&lt;br&gt;

After several failed attempts, I got it working. I will post a complete list of all I did to make this work as soon as I get a chance. And yes, I would be happy to test fixed before you release it.

&lt;br&gt;
I apologize for not getting to this sooner. The steps I took to get server shares to yield the tagged search results are as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server share folder has the NTFS permission 'System' - Full Control. I believe this is needed for indexing.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install FileMeta on server and workstation(s). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use FileMeta to add extensions as needed. Make sure that if you add to Workstation, also add to Server.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Server 2008, add the File Services role -&amp;gt; then the Windows Search Service role (not the Indexing Service role).
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Server 2008, open the indexing options and add the Server share folder to the indexing locations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
That was what it took for me to get searches working.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
No, they will not be impacted. File Meta will not. Interfere with any file extension where metadata property handling is already defined, whether by Windows, Office, or any other third party program.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Yes, with a little tweaking. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Windows Explorer knows how to deal with a file extension based on its registry entry. These are set up either by default as part of Windows setup, or when some software that edits files with the extension is installed.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The File Meta Association Manager simply reads all the file extension registry entries and displays them, so the fact that the extensions you want are not showing up implies that they don't exist in the registry.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It is therefore necessary to either install some software that handles files with that extension, or create the entry manually. Happily, the entry you need is as minimal as it gets, so manual creation using regedit is a breeze. All you have to have is a key
 under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT whose name is the extension preceded by a dot. It does not need to have any values at all. For instance, the entry for the OUT extension would be:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 &lt;br&gt;
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.OUT] &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That's it. Once this entry exists in the registry, the extension will show up in the File Meta Association Manager (when you restart it) and you can add the File Meta Property Handler to it and start editing metadata. Note that you may need to kill all instances
 of explorer.exe and restart it before you can save values successfully. &lt;br&gt;

        Thanks for the info, that worked. You appear to have a ton of knowledge in this area - I have a question about updating the extended property value for the TAGS property using PowerShell, VB or C++. I have done some searching but have not come
 across any commands that might work. I am able to view the extended properties for each file using "getDetailsof" command but I am really interested in finding out how to update (programmatically) the TAGS property for about 500,000 files located
 in 100,000 folders on an NTFS file system without having to use the Windows Explorer interface. Do you know if this can be done and if so what command and language would work best?&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Yes, it is possible. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The important thing is to hook into the property system in the same way that Windows Explorer does. This ensures that you pick up any Property Handler that is installed for an extension, whether it is one of those that comes with Windows, e.g. for Office Documents
 or JPEG’s, or the File Meta Property Handler, or one installed by third party software.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
At the Windows API level, the C++ code needed looks something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;IShellItem2Ptr pShellItem2;
hr = SHCreateItemFromParsingName(L“full path”, NULL, IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;amp;pShellItem2));

if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
{
    PROPVARIANT pv;
    PropVariantInit(&amp;amp;pv);
            
    hr = pShellItem2-&amp;gt;GetProperty(PKEY_Keywords, &amp;amp;pv);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Happily, Microsoft have taken this and a lot more and wrapped it up for use from .Net languages like VB, in the form of the Windows API code pack, downloadable from
&lt;a href="http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/WindowsAPICodePack" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/WindowsAPICodePack&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Even better, a sample called PropertyEdit is included which supports command lines like the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PropertyEdit.exe  -get System.Keywords test.jpg
PropertyEdit.exe  -set System.Keywords “tag1;tag2” test.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that System.Keywords is the official name of the tags property. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, I think, if you download the Windows API code pack, the source for the PropertyEdit sample will show you how to do it from VB, or if you compile it, you will have something usable from PowerShell. Or, if you're feeling hard core, there's always C++ and
 the Windows API. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to testing out the API code pack. It appears that PropertyEdit.EXE only works for Windows supported file types and not the custom ones that I had setup using the File Association Manager. I am able to view and update the System.Keywords
 for Word documents and Image file types supported by Windows 7, but when trying to view System.Keywords for custom file types the code returns Null values and when I try to "Set" a new value for custom file types the code returns an error:

Error 80004005: getting the propertystore for the item.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The PropertyEdit code calls GetPropertyStore which does not include the custom file types. I am not sure if it would be possible to create a custom property store that would include the custom file types... or if there is any other way of updating the tags
 for a custom file type?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Have you tried killing all instances of Explorer.exe and restarting it, or alternatively logging off and on? Explorer caches what it reads from the registry, and sometimes this is necessary to make the changes effective.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you have done this, and are still having problems, we will need to look deeper.

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thank you also for this wonderful program! &lt;br&gt;
I just installed it an "playing around". It works as described. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I´m unsin teracopy 2.3 (latest) beacause of some issues of explorer. &lt;br&gt;
If I copy/move on the same drive even teracopy works as expeced but if you copy to different Drive (also NTFS) all metadata are gone...
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Any hint for me ? &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi BG63 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This sounds like a limitation of teracopy. It is not surprising that movement within a drive works: in the world of NTFS, this is just a fie rename, and so very unlikely to be destructive. However, when copying between drives, teracopy would have to intentionally
 copy all of the streams in the file, rather than just the default stream, and it appears that it does not do this.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If this is the case, then there is no workaround other than to export the metadata before the copy, and to reapply it after the copy. The command line support beta that I have released would allow you to do this for all the files in a folder at once.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:; font-size: 9pt;"&gt;Hi BG63 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This sounds like a limitation of teracopy. It is not surprising that movement within a drive works: in the world of NTFS, this is just a fie rename, and so very unlikely to be destructive. However, when copying between drives, teracopy would have to intentionally
 copy all of the streams in the file, rather than just the default stream, and it appears that it does not do this.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If this is the case, then there is no workaround other than to export the metadata before the copy, and to reapply it after the copy. The command line support beta that I have released would allow you to do this for all the files in a folder at once.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;The key question is not so much what is the property handler, but where the property handler stores the properties.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If, like File Meta, the properties are stored in a standard location in the file system (NTFS), but outside the main content of the file, then the metadata will not automatically be transported with the file when it is moved or copied outside the file system.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If, like the Windows supplied property handlers for Office documents, JPEG ‘s, etc, the properties are stored the main content of the file in locations defined by the specific file format, then the metadata will be transported with the file, but it will only
 be possible to store a given metadata property if it is specified by the file format (for instance, PDFs do not have a well-defined location for a comment property), and each file format must be supported by a property handler that understands that format
 (thus, Windows cannot store metadata properties for many file formats out of the box.)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As far as I know, there are no other classes of solutions to this problem. File Meta is an improvement on solutions that store metadata in a central database, as at least the metadata moves around with the file within NTFS (bar the use of something like teracopy
 to do the moves). It is also an improvement on file format dependent storage, because it works for all file formats. However, it is not a universal solution. I don't believe that any such solution exists, even for simple properties such as tag or category.

&lt;br&gt;
The implication is that there is another .pdf property handler already installed. File Meta won't tread on anything else's toes, by design. Does anything show to the right of the entry for .pdf? To the right of .mp3, for example, you'll see MF MP3 Property
 Handler. Some are gray without a name, like .ocx, and if it's one of those we'll need to look deeper.

One question - Have noticed that updating the enhanced properties of a large file (1.5GB) takes 20-30 seconds to complete. What's going on in that process? Was that native to your extension or was it always that way and I just never noticed before...&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for your kind words - and for putting them into a review. I’m very happy that you're finding my work useful.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To answer your question, this behaviour has always been there. Not that I knew that until I ran a few tests on reading your post. A key principle of File Meta is to delegate as completely to NTFS as possible, on the grounds that it is way more tested and reliable
 than anything I could ever imagine writing myself. So all I do is invoke the high-level NTFS-provided property setting API, and the characteristic that you have found is a characteristic of NTFS.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am somewhat surprised to observe this slowdown when setting properties on large files, since the properties set by File Meta are held, by definition, in a separate stream to the so-called 'default' stream that holds the payload data for the file and is the
 overwhelming contributor to its size. I can think of no obvious reason why to update (i.e. rewrite) the stream holding the properties should take longer as the default stream gets larger. But there you are, it appears to be the case that it does. We would
 have to ask an NTFS developer why. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am using version 1.1. Selecting one file extension, it seems I must select one of the 2 profiles of editable properties. It seems, then, that I cannot just add custom properties at will (outside of a given profile). And it seems I cannot create my own profile
 of editable properties. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
No, you are quite right.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I did originally think about allowing users to create custom profiles. The File Association Manager in the Beta version even went as far as showing all the installed properties in a panel (600+ on a typical Windows machine) so that in a later version they could
 be dragged onto a profile to customise it. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, the feedback I got (e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.downloadcrew.com/article/30413-file_metadata_10_beta_64-bit" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://www.downloadcrew.com/article/30413-file_metadata_10_beta_64-bit&lt;/a&gt;) was that the resulting UI was too complex, and so I simplified it for the 1.0 version.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I don't think that I would go back on that now, but I could imagine a separate 'Advanced File Association Manager' with a full profile editing capability. Do you think that such a thing would be broadly useful?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
BTW If anybody else wants to chime in here, feel free. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
If I understood properly, it seems that, in the beta version, you could choose from a set of already installed properties. But, could you create your own properties. I really think that it would be great to have and Advance option where you could:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1.- Create your own of properties. &lt;br&gt;
2.- To group them in custom namespaces. &lt;br&gt;
3.- The group again them in profiles. &lt;br&gt;
4.- To associate to a file either properties one by one, all in a namespace, or all in a profle.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Why do I need it? I think Windows Explorer, although maybe not perfect, it's quite good and powerful, and far more advanced that other file system browsers in Windows and other platforms (not being able to handle properly &amp;gt; 256 paths might be it's only real
 limitation). Having lots of documents and books, I dislike needing to have a dedicated software to manage them, as I think Windows Explorer does the trick with a proper way to handle and manage meta properties. This way, I don't need to duplicate management
 efforts (file system + dedicated software). As I want to use Windows Explorer as my books library, I want to be able to have my own properties as, for instance, when I read it, how many times did I read it, when I am planing to read it, etc. I don't want to
 be tied to pre-existing properties that might not suit my needs. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I would really love to be able to help you, but Windows programming is not my forte.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What do you think about all these things? &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dijji, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sorry for being off-topic, but I've got a problem that took me some time to figure out. If you add a profile (let's say, Office DSOFile) to a given extension (xlsx in my case) and then I remove it, I Can still see the properties of this file extension in Windows
 Explorer (bottom panel), I can edit them, but then I get an error when saving. If I save properties opening the excel file, they are not visible in the bottom panel. Adding the profile again fixes the problem.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In any case, I think it would be a nice feature being able to safely rolling back an action, reassigning the previous status of an extension, even after a long time. What do you think about this?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am getting excited about how useful and powerful your utility could be... &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Dimas &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I will try to explain how the pieces you will need fit together. There are three important aspects: defining properties, storage of properties associated with a file, and editing properties.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
a) Property definitions &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Windows comes with a whole set of property definitions. There are more than 600 of them, listed here:
&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd561977(v=VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd561977(v=VS.85).aspx&lt;/a&gt;. You can define custom properties, too. Once defined, they are equal citizens with the system-defined properties. However, defining them is not that straightforward, you need to register them
 and provide a lot of information. Here, for example, is the definition for the System.Keywords property:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb787519(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb787519(v=vs.85).aspx&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Looking through the predefined system properties, I don't see anything that will meet your needs, so I think that the first piece you will need is a custom property editor. I don't actually know of one, but if you find a good one, do let me know.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
b) Property storage &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Once the properties that you need have been defined, and you want to apply them to a file, you need to consider how they will be stored. The Windows property system uses 'property handlers' to read and write property values. A property handler must be registered
 for each file type (i.e. extension) with editable properties. Windows comes with built-in property handlers for file types like Office documents and jpeg. However, since these property handlers store the properties within the files, they can only read and
 write properties that can be mapped onto some storage location in the file format. This goes for third-party property handlers too: for instance, one well-known property handler for PDF files will write tags, but not comment, because PDF files do not have
 a well-defined locations for comment. It follows that custom properties are going to present particular problems.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One solution is to use File Meta, which will store any property, including custom properties, against any file type. It works this trick by storing the properties in an annex to the file rather than in the file itself, so that it is independent of the file
 format. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
c) Property editing. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The last piece needed is a user interface to edit the properties. File Meta uses Windows Explorer to do this. WPSEdit is an alternative editor. It does not address the problems of custom property definition or property storage.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
File Meta tells Explorer which properties to display for which file type through registry settings that are manipulated using the File Association Manager, grouping the properties in profiles. The beta version did not allow the creation of custom profiles,
 it merely displayed the set of properties defined on the system, but didn't let you do anything with them. If your custom properties were already defined, then they would be shown too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As I said in my previous reply, it would be feasible to extend the File Association Manager to support custom profiles. However, this would be of no use to you unless you also have a way to define the custom properties that you need.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, in conclusion, if you can find a custom property definition tool that suits your needs, let me know, and I can look at extending the File Association Manager to support custom profiles. File Meta can already help you store the properties. Alternatively,
 you can switch on your custom properties in Explorer with a few relatively simple registry edits, or use an alternative property editor such as WPSEdit.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I hope this makes things clearer. Do let me know how you get on. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi again Dimas &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You see this rather odd behaviour because Explorer caches the registry settings when it reads them.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, when you remove .xlsx in the File Association Manager, the registry settings are updated appropriately, but Explorer does not reread them, and still shows the properties as being editable. However, when it tries to write their values, this fails, because
 the property handler has been removed from the registry, and the property system cannot create an instance of it to write the properties.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is not a beautiful thing. However, I don't know, at the moment, of any way of forcing Explorer to reread the registry other than killing all instances of it and restarting it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I don't think that rollback addresses this problem, because it arises when the state of registry is out of sync with the state of Explorer, so rolling back registry changes won't actually do much to help, unless you happen to arrive at the state that matches
 the in memory state in Explorer, and I don't see how you would know when this was true.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If I was thinking of doing rollback, I think I would have the File Association Manager capture the state of the settings for a file extension when it first encountered it, and give the user the option to rollback to them at any subsequent time. But since, at
 the moment, the File Association Manager only allows you to change the settings for a file extension with no property handler, the initial state is always the empty state, and so rollback would be identical to remove handler. If I ever allow existing property
 handler settings to be overwritten, then I think rollback would be important. &lt;br&gt;

Just go ahead and uninstall 1.0 and then install 1.1. All file associations will be left intact unless you explicitly remove them using File Association Manager.&lt;br&gt;

Thank you for a wonderful program! &lt;br&gt;
There are 3 major problems:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Properties are removed when writing files to the flash drive with &lt;strong&gt;FAT32&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inability to read / write properties from/to txt in &lt;strong&gt;batch mode&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Problems with import and export data from/to the xml (Visual C++ &lt;strong&gt;Runtime Error&lt;/strong&gt;)

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Hunter23071985 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I’m glad you're finding the program useful, and thank you for this feedback. Feedback is always good! Taking each of your points in turn:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1) Properties are removed when writing files to the flash drive with FAT32.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is a known limitation, and almost a defining characteristic, of File Metadata. As it says on the File Metadata home page, “the metadata is lost when a file is, say, emailed, or moved to a FAT file system”. On NTFS, alternate streams are used to store metadata
 in an annex to a file, so that it goes automatically wherever the file goes. There is simply no equivalent mechanism in FAT. The only way I know of to support metadata properties for arbitrary file types on FAT is to store them in some central location, as
 XP did. However, this technique is very vulnerable to file movement, as it is necessary to hook into everything that might move a file in order to trigger an update to the metadata repository or repositories involved, something that is beyond any reasonable
 scope for File Metadata. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
2) Inability to read / write properties from/to txt in batch mode. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do you mean something like: select multiple files in Windows Explorer, right click, and export metadata for all of them using the context menu? If so, do you envisage the production of a single XML metadata file for all the selected files, or an XML metadata
 file per selected file? In any case, could you say a little more about the scenario you have in mind?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
3) Problems with import and export data from/to the xml (Visual C++ Runtime Error)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am not aware of any outstanding bugs in this area. Could you tell me what errors you get and the steps you take before they occur please?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Thanks for answers! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1) &lt;strong&gt;Got it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
2) &lt;strong&gt;Meant the ability to read and write metadata with CMD/BAT/VBS.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That is, the ability to read metadata from the specified files and records in the specified files from the usual TXT-file.
&lt;br&gt;
It would be convenient for batch processing and restoring metadata. &lt;br&gt;
3) &lt;strong&gt;I'll try to explain.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The sequence of my actions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a File Meta Property Handler for txt / pdf, restart the Explorer &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write and save metadata in txt / pdf &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the context menu choose Metadata - Export to &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a Visual C++ Runtime Error (periodically) and always empty file: &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;_Start_
&amp;lt;Metadata&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Storage Description = "DocumentSummaryInformation"
FormatID = "{D5CDD502-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Property Name="System.Category" Id="2" Type="VT_LPSTR" TypeId="30"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt;
_End_&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hi Hunter23071985 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
2) Because File Metadata just plugs into the Windows property system, anything that will access properties on Office documents or JPEGs, whose metadata is handled entirely by Windows out-of-the-box, will also access properties of file types handled by File
 Metadata. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Having said that, I don't know of any good command line programs that do this. For access to properties from a script, Microsoft provides DSOFile here:
&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;amp;id=8422" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;amp;id=8422&lt;/a&gt;, and describes it here:
&lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee692828.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee692828.aspx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In fact, in my test suite for File Metadata, included in my Sources download, I round trip more than 600 different writable Windows metadata properties through DSOFile and File Metadata, to make sure that this scenario works correctly.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, if you can't find any suitable command line program, you can at least write scripts and run them from batch files and the command line.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
3) It looks like XML serialisation has failed trying to write the value of the System.Category property. That's why you see an opening &amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; tag at the end of the file, without the value or closing &amp;lt;/Value&amp;gt; tag.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Could you tell me what the value is? You can find out by looking at the Details Tab in the Properties dialog for the file in Windows Explorer. The value is labelled ‘Categories’ in the first group, ‘Description’. You should also be able to work around the problem
 by editing the value that you see. &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Oh dear, and I was feeling pretty confident, too. Are you importing XML exported from 1.0? If so, this is the expected result: only 1.1 can export properties containing Cyrillic values. Otherwise, would it be possible for you to give me a copy of the XML
 that won't import? I think that you can attach it to the issue I opened for this problem.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Export of properties containing Cyrillic characters failed silently in 1.0. If you look at the XML file produced, it typically ends with &amp;lt;Value&amp;gt; plus a few garbage characters. These files cannot be imported: a correctly formed exported XML file ends with
 &amp;lt;/Metadata&amp;gt;, as you should see in all files exported by 1.1.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;OK, I have posted an updated version of 1.1 that corrects the problem (build 1.1.4990). It was a very good catch, as it turns out that a few Unicode characters give the XML library I'm using a problem. My test data did not happen to include any, but the
 м in Тема is one of them. The problem is now fixed, and the tests have been extended.

This can occur when you've only just added the File Meta Property Handler for a particular extension (using the File Association Manager), because Explorer holds prior state in memory to improve performance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Please kill all instances of explorer.exe, and reload it (or logoff and on, or reboot) and try again. Let me know what happens!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I've had 0x80004005 errors and I fixed them by killing and restarting Explorer.exe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The 0x80004005 error happens during "save" after adding any property, with FileMeta(x64).msi (1.036.288 bytes):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The steps to take are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1.Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+ESC).&lt;br&gt;
2.Right click explorer.exe and select End Process Tree&lt;br&gt;
3.Ctrl+R (Run command), type EXPLORER (maybe contain "exe", maybe not) and ENTER&lt;br&gt;
4.Enjoy, you can change any properties &amp;amp; SAVE.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;0x80004005 is the most vague of error messages. Its technical name is E_FAIL, the E being for error. It tends to be used as the default error for anything that goes wrong.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have seen it during development, but I wouldn't expect it to occur during normal usage of File Meta.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When I have seen it, it is usually a consequence of the way that Windows Explorer works. File Meta is loaded by Windows Explorer into the Explorer process the first time that it is needed, typically when reading metadata properties for a file. However, Explorer
 very rarely lets go of code that it has loaded, preferring to keep it in memory in case it ever needs it again. So if the state of the system changes outside Explorer, e.g. when registry entries are changed, the inconsistencies between the new state of the
 system and that held in memory by Explorer can cause this error.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The most reliable way of getting back to a good state is indeed to kill and restart Explorer.exe. However, if this needs to be done in normal usage, please let me know, and I will look into possible causes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;Hello, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I would like to try it, looks really useful, but should I expect some degradation in Windows search performance or indexing?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
thanks!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="markDownOutput "&gt;That is an interesting question. I have not noticed any degradation in the performance of indexing or search, but I can think of reasons why there might be.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Clearly, extra work has to be done for each file for which the properties are read. The effect will be proportional to how many files of a type for which File Meta provides the property handler are accessed. I can say that almost all of the code path involved
 is code that is part of Windows, either in Explorer or NTFS, both areas to which a great deal of optimisation has been applied. My code contributes about 40 lines per file, plus 2 lines per property. Also, the properties are system-defined properties held
 in a property store that is system-provided and purpose specific, so property reading should be as lightweight as it gets. But, obvious sensible precautions to avoid any possible degradation are to make File Meta the property handler only for file types for
 which you intend to set metadata properties, and to choose the Simple Profile if it includes all the properties that you need, to reduce the number of properties that are read.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For search, the files for which properties are read will be those in the searched directory and its subfolders, and any delay will be directly experienced. As I said above, I have not noticed any impact, but I have no metrics to support this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For indexing, the set of files for which properties are read is often every file on the system, which makes performance more critical. On the other hand, indexing is done in the background, so any delay is likely not to be experienced directly. It is worth
 noting, however, that File Meta cannot use the preferred out of process background indexing approach, because it is not looking at properties in the default stream (see
&lt;a href="http://filemeta.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Search" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://filemeta.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Search&lt;/a&gt;) . Again, I have not observed any impact, but have no numbers concerning this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you have any issues, or can provide any data to measure the impact, I would be very interested to hear about them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
